1,"I started a 1000$ (1087$ to be exact) trading journey in october of last year. I traded a lot of Oil companies, NIO and some solar companies and invested what I gained in AAPL, JPM and MSFT to ""secure"" profits. When I had some more I went for Silver Futures and that went fine. Currently I try to allocate some of my riskier positions to FAANG, but I got weak and bought some more PLTR.

I‚Äôve owned AAPL for decades and continue to accumulate.  I use my long position to write covered options, from time to time.  I have an over weight position in AAPL, but, it really doesn‚Äôt worry me.

One of my other large, long-time holdings is NVDA.  You may see a similar chart there.  NVDA‚Äôs chart stayed flat for the last six months, then took off by a $100/share increase prior to earnings.  I expect AAPL to move to the upside, soon.",2021-02-17 05:27:41,2021-02-17,-0.3329

With the run up in AAPL‚Äôs share price, taking profits from a long-term investment is reasonable - particularly when pairing gains with tax - losses.  I noticed that Buffet sold off and took losses on his Wells Fargo position.  I believe the loss in Wells Fargo was around 53%.  I haven‚Äôt done the math, but, I would suspect that sales of Apple and Wells Fargo would offset one another (tax wise).  This is just one aspect of successful fund management.

7,"I think that the whole concept of AAPL partnering to create EV‚Äôs is not the best idea.  AAPL creates high end, high margin electronic devices, media and the like.  Automobiles are a low-margin product, requiring massive investment in infrastructure.  

Furthermore, very little money is made from the vehicle manufacture.  Tesla makes most of its money (insofar as vehicle manufacture) from carbon credits.  If a majority of the vehicles being manufactured become EVs, that value will diminish.

A significant portion of my portfolio is in Apple stock - I‚Äôve owned it for decades and continue to buy.  In my opinion, AAPL shareholders would be better served staying out of the EV market.",2021-02-17 05:05:36,2021-02-17,0.873

It seems the support line is on 132 now so I'm holding for now, but will exit if it hits 129-130 as it might be breaking out.

sRSI says oversold, also low volume seems to point to not a real breakout happening today at 132.

If it is not breaking out, it seems to be bouncing back to 145ish some time around March. And yeah even further if it breaks through the roof.

In the case of AAPL I don't check any fundamentals because the amount of articles written about this company is just crazy to go through.

So many times I see people regretting how they sold AAPL, TSLA, AMD, and others. Well, before selling, you should consider whether you'll be okay with the possibility that the stock grows another 100%, or even more, and you'll be missing out. If you think that it still has potential to outperform the market in the long term, but you feel a rally has been maybe a little over-extended, just sell 10%, 20%, or 50% of the stock, or whatever.

Even if you want to exit a position all together, doing it gradually over time might be better. It's basically dollar cost averaging. You will not be kicking yourself because you missed the perfect opportunity to sell, or that you sold at a low. You'll know that you stuck to your strategy, even if the outcome was not optimal.

I never did.   We archive our chat client and years later I searched and found the chat versions of the conversation where I said I was going to buy at $110 or something

The key to becoming the EV King is going to come down to who can crack a range that is at least 1.5x typical gas range (something like a 400-500 mile range to get rid of stigma) at the 25,000 price point.

The issue is, battery research is not easy. Tesla is  at the forefront experimenting with both Lithium Iron Phosphate and Lithium Ion, but they're not able to crack that $25,000 price just yet. In addition, they're facing issues being associated with not having experience as a traditional auto manufacture company (such as after-market repair, overall quality control).

93,"&gt; If you don't mind me asking: What size portfolio (is it 100k or is it larger),

when i started selling covered calls, i was at around 50-55k. currently, i'm at about 95k, quickly inching towards the 100k mark (got as high as 98k before a dip last week), plus some margin not included in that number (so the 95-98k is my total value - the margin).

&gt;what positions

i don't necessarily have all of these any more, as some were called away (deliberately in some cases,because like when delta had grown  over 75% from when i bought in, and at the time i was skeptic about it holding that value and  expecting a dip, so i sold VERY aggressive covered calls at like $1 over the current price at the time until it eventually sold. in other cases, just a result of the companies growing more than expected, like when DIS went through the roof the day the first vaccine was announced). that being said, the companies i have sold calls against are:

* AAPL
* T
* HRZN (this isn't really a good company for CC's right now due to low premiums with monthly calls being the only options at prices that seem way too low to justify) 
* IRM (same deal as HRZN, but not quite as bad so i'll check these every week, and sometimes i'll find a premium i'll jump for)
* MO
* XOM
* CCL
* DAL
* DIS
* OXY
* WFC
* RKT
* UMC
* EXPI

of course, as stated, some of these have gotten called away, so i don't have all those shares currently.

&gt;and what is your typical strike price as a percentage above market?

honestly, i don't pay too much attention to the percentage. i use more of a gut feel weighing the risk/reward. i'll look at the premiums and say ""what do i think the odds are this will go up $x over that time span"" and shoot for the best premium i can get that i feel pretty comfortable with. when doing this, i'll look at the price history for the company to see when the last time it hit that price was and what the trajectory has been. i'd feel super comfortable selling $33 monthly covered calls of T for example when it's sitting at $30/share, but wouldn't necessarily feel so comfortable doing the same thing with most other companies.

another thing i do is keep exdates in mind and make sure that if the call is going to be near an exdate, that i pick a date shortly AFTER rather than shortly before. there's no need to have the dividend hunters artificially spike up the price right before my options expire.

also, sometimes i'll also buy shares with the sole intent of letting them get called away. a recent example is EXPI. i was excited about the company and wanted some shares. the premium for shares $1 over the sell price at the time on a 2 week call was an insane $11/share. i grabbed a stack and immediately did one of those calls. will it hit? sure. will i be making $1200 off of it? yup. (and at the same time i also grabbed 100 shares that i intended to keep, and sold a much more conservative call against that one for like $40 over the current price, which still had a $3/share premium, and honestly, if that gets called away, i'm really not going to be too upset after that kind of profit. that being said i don't expect it to and i plan to hold these and sell calls on for years to come)

&gt;Do you sell weeklies or do biweeklies then buy back at a lower premium on dips?

still kind of figuring that out. i was mainly doing weekly, but the last month or so i have shifted towards biweekly because it's been giving me a higher per week average (for example, maybe on a given company i get 3 cents a share  on weeklies, but 8 cents a share on biweekly which would average to 4 cents a week).

typically for companies that have higher premiums (around $1 if not more), i'm more apt to do weekly calls. for companies in the 1 to 5 cent range, i'm more apt to do bi-weekly or even monthly calls.

if my shares do sell, i always keep an eye on the price and look for a dip to buy them back cheaper than i sold them.",2021-02-15 16:49:32,2021-02-15,0.9972

Well, if the stop drops to $128 during market hours and then drops to $122 after hours, when the market opens, the stock price will be below your limit which triggers a sell. You've now sold at $122, which is $3 below your stop price

Just because you have a limit set, it isn't going to automatically sell for that.  It'll sell for that price or lower.

What are you basing it's value on? bLOckBusTer? 

The entire point is that once they announce said transition to e-commerce and high plans are revealed the stock will rocket and cause another squeeze which will yes, organically driven just like TSLA did. There will be a serious if squeezes until HF etc lose enough and admit defeat.

Just curious, how much do you depend on long dated calls or are you strictly buying shares? Your point about diversification though, I believe a lot of sectors will boom the next few years under Biden. I don't have a ton of free cash but about 10k I plan to buy long dated leaps with 5m+. Would I be better off firing all $10k at 1/2 or would 5 work? Genome/Health (BNG.O/ORTX)CE(QCLN)/EV(TSLA)/PC(LOGI/HEAR/MU/AMD)/DATA(PLTR) 

I have about $10k in various CRYPTO plays CAN/RIOT/MARA. 

I also have $10k in ""meme"" stocks with long value BB/NOK/GME/RKT/CRSR.

Am I over extended you think? I feel incredibly strong about BTC this year especially with ELON buying so much. Once AAPL follows or Morgan Stanley as suspected game over. Millionaire status. 

I am absolutely certain BTC breaks $150-200k by EOY. Should I just go all in with those plays since I feel so strongly? PC I am also dead certain about. AMD/LOGI/CRSR/HEAR/MU will crush this year too.

EV don't know anything about really. 

Nokia building on the fucking moon. Do I need to say more? They are literally sending üöÄto the üåù. 

GME I believe Ryan Cohen will be successful. My cost average is only $100 and am absolutely certain if he is then $800+ by summer next year is organic. NOK/GME are legitimate long plays IMO and I really am not saying that just because ""bags"". They're üí∞ in my eyes. 

Any thoughts? I'm also selling CC on PLTR for 5-700 a week off 300 shares. I'm reinvesting half into building my CC position and the other I'm keeping in cash for opportunities.

112,"&gt;If you see what happened to ZM from October to December, I can easily see something like that happening to a variety of different growth stocks that are completely mispriced.

Totally agree. I think EVs are generally mispriced, ZM is an easy one. Probably others like Fiverr, Upwork, or Docusign (not these in particular, just using them as an example of the type of stock I'm talking about) will stagnate for a LONG time. But as someone whose primary holdings are MSFT, AAPL, and SMH (with smaller holdings in qqqj, arkf and arkg) I struggle to see that the assets I own are in a bubble (though valuations are getting rich, besides MSFT imo). I think there might be bubbles, but the bubbles seem smaller and more sector or theme-specific than anything.

&gt;They use historical prices to back it up

I never see these people factor in bond yields and how this affects asset allocation when talking about this. (among the many other data points that run against the fearful narrative)",2021-02-15 07:34:01,2021-02-15,0.6344
113,"I started by reading a few dozen books on investing, understanding balance sheets and financials, and a few specific industries like mining, shipping, oil &amp; gas. Took lots of notes whenever I read something interesting that made me think ""Huh, who knew.""  

I then looked at companies in various sectors or industries and made lots and lots of spreadsheets with data about companies in that given sector to determine which company was #1 or had the largest growth potential in that sector. In that way I was able to weed out those companies that were overvalued and was left with those that either were solid value investing companies or had the best long-term potential of growth. Of course this doesn't work all the time but it works more often than not which is all you need in the stock market.  

That is for about 50% of my portfolio. Another 25% are in tech companies like FB, AAPL, etc. Much less research there and basically just bought a spread of tech companies 5-8 years ago.  

And the last 25% of the portfolio are in more risky plays but again with lots of DD and trying to find out if balance sheets are good, if there is positive cash flow, return on investment, P/E ratio.  

I do use Twitter a lot to find investment ideas and exchange ideas with fellow investors.  

I also subscribe to a number of paid databases and industry publications.  

And as a last point, whenever something ""big"" happens in the world I try to think: ""Ok, so which companies will benefit from this."" E.g. with Covid I was looking for work from home and home fitness companies. Or when there is increased conflict with Iran or sanctions on Chinese oil tankers I invest e.g. in oil tanker companies.  

Overall I try to keep all emotions out of trading. I do research, make a plan, try to play devil's advocate to see if there are counter arguments to my thesis, if it is still sound I invest and set target prices. I monitor the price daily, but not in 30 min increments. When the price is reached I either sell or I re-evaluate if e.g. the thesis has gotten even stronger, then I may hold until a higher price point.  

That's pretty much it.  

Edit: Oh and lots and lots of google alerts. I have a lot of keyword alerts for companies or industries I am invested in. And I have a calendar with quarterly earnings dates and other key dates so I don't get surprised by things. And I keep super detailed records of all my trades which was around 150 transactions in 2020.",2021-02-15 06:05:23,2021-02-15,0.99

If you wish to grow your money with reduced risk, there is absolutely nothing wrong with a nicely well set portfolio and adding to it over time on a **consistent** basis. This requires you to do 0 analysis, 0 time dedicated towards studying stocks, analysts, etc. etc. It's all just noise.

Here's an example in action - *Bear in mind the S&amp;P500 peaked in November 2007 and didn't return to that level until April 2013.*

Say in 2007 you had $10,000 and you finally decided to plunk it into the stock market.. tired of seeing everyone else make money. We know what happens over the next 5 years, so let's take a look.

&amp;#x200B;

1. You invest all $10K split      equally in the S&amp;P500 ETF ($SPY - 50%) and Nasdaq ($QQQ - 50%) on Jan      1st 2007, rebalancing annually and re-invest dividends **but not      contributing anything ever again**.

So what happened? By October 2007, you had reached almost a 20% return!!      Yay!! Celebration time! Then as you see, you went on to lose 40% of your      initial capital. Regardless, if you just hung on, you will have returned      to your $10K just as 2011 was coming around. That's a tough 3 years and your      confidence is shot - the news is fixated on Greece debt collapsing, then      Italy, then Spain, then the whole Eurozone! Oh no better sell, right?      Well, no. If you just hung on.. by end of 2013 when the S&amp;P500 is back      to where it was when you started and your $10K is now nearly $15K. **And      you did absolutely nothing but hold on.**
2. Now imagine you decided to      put $1,000 to start, and contribute the remaining $9000 in blocks - $1,500      at the start of every new year. Same allocation as above: [https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=2007&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2013&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=1000&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=1500&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1\_1=50&amp;symbol2=QQQ&amp;allocation2\_1=50](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=2007&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2013&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;calendarAligned=true&amp;includeYTD=false&amp;initialAmount=1000&amp;annualOperation=1&amp;annualAdjustment=1500&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;absoluteDeviation=5.0&amp;relativeDeviation=25.0&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;showYield=false&amp;showFactors=false&amp;factorModel=3&amp;portfolioNames=false&amp;portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&amp;portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&amp;portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&amp;symbol1=SPY&amp;allocation1_1=50&amp;symbol2=QQQ&amp;allocation2_1=50)  
So what happened? By October 2007, you were up a measly $1,192 which is      still almost 20% but only of $1K.. and you have $9K sitting around doing      nothing. But then you stay on schedule and deposit $1,500 every year.. even      when the news is telling you the world is collapsing and you end up with      $20K at the end of 2013 - a total 200% return on your $10K or an insane      50% cumulative annual growth rate.

Now, you can either focus taking the lazy investing route and spend your energy on maximizing how much you put in (i.e. your day job/savings). Or you can take the more challenging/rewarding route of spending time fine tuning which stocks you put it into. If you replace the above SPY/QQQ with AAPL/GOOG you would have and even more impressive return..

But neither Apple or Google were sure things back then, although they were revolutionary.

[https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/) is a great tool. Use it and IMO focus on putting in more when you're younger. I.e. Stick to your day job and growing your earning capacity. When your earnings go up, you can put more in and compounding does magical things in your 40s.

138,"I have equal large positions in GrowGeneration (GRWG) and Hydrofarm (HYFM) . GrowGeneration gets much more publicity by being featured on Cramer's Mad Money but it's share price may have gotten ahead of itself valuation wise. 

Hydrofarm is more under the radar and less well known so I would put new money here before GrowGeneration because a little additional publicity for Hydrofarm will cause it leg up again due to its smaller (33 million) shares outstanding. Technicals aside, this a strong future long term just like GRWG does. 

Agrify (AGFY) is magnitudes lower in profit potential than GrowGen or Hydrofarm due the fact that the scalability of a services company is less than a retail or manufacturing operation like GRWG and HYFM are,, respectively, but will be a decent ancillary cannabis play as all boats will be lifted with the rising waters of increasing cannabis interest.

Prominent cannabis fund manager and CNBC Fast Money regular, Tim Seymour, is loading up on it ( https://www.amplifyetfs.com/cnbs-holdings.html ) and I am too. Cramer is also giving WeedMaps publicity on Mad Money and suspect he will have it on again after ticker change which will cause it to skyrocket, just like he caused GRWG to skyrocket after having them on for the first time. This is where I would put my next dollar of fresh cannabis investment money if I had to. I even trimmed some of my MSFT and AAPL profits in order to add to this one. I think this has 200% appreciation potential by year end. Really bulled up about this one.",2021-02-13 14:51:11,2021-02-13,0.9969

142,"&gt; In 2010 AAPL had a pe ratio of 17, tesla has one of over 1000, dont even try to compare these two.

**1)** Just to demonstrate how silly your P/E valuation argument is: early 2016 Amazon GAAP P/E ratio was **482** and it was trading at $550. Today, 5 years later, AMZN is trading 6x higher at $3,270...

**2)** I.e. no competent analyst uses backward looking GAAP P/E ratio based valuation for hyper-growth companies, because those don't and cannot account for future cash flows. If investing in companies was as simple as looking at P/E ratios then everybody with elementary school math skills would be able to pick the winners early on. But it's not that simple, GAAP P/E ratio based valuation only makes sense for low growth companies with an established, mature revenue stream. Valuing hyper-growth companies requires a thorough understanding of their business model, a detailed look at their growth path &amp; a reasonable model of its future.

229,"I appreciate the input , YET daytrading in pennystocks is probably on the more dangerous side of giving advice, especially for very inexperienced traders. 
I wholeheartedly think that even though you can make money with it and learn quiet a bit, it offers brand new pitfalls on their own:
1. too much pump and dump
prices are way too low which means with significant capital an extreme volatility can be forced. hence pennystocks are much more prone to pump and dump schemes. 
2. no real equity
most pennystocks are basically worthless. as you mentioned, its more of a daytrading thing and only very rarel the stocks offer real equity value to hold and wait. thus you are either stuck in a more or less worthless position or sell at a loss if a price does not move in the assumed direction. 
3. low prices lure you in, yet the risks remain the same. 
its an easy thought and a major trap to fall into thinking ""oh well, its only a few cents.. no real risk here"" and this would be true, if only people would only limit themselves to a few bucks here and there. 
yet the low entry costs more often than not makes people dump in way too much money because shares are so stupid cheap. instead of buying 100 to try things out, learn etc. they buy 1000 or 10000 shares. which brings you to the same amount of money invested as you would into normal stocks. with the only drawback that there really is not much equity value in your 10000 pennystocks you just bought. while in return you might be able to own 1 stock of something like AAPL, which is a much much better investment, even if prices drop.

my personal advise for beginners: stay way way clear of pennystocks. 
unless you can really limit yourself and have your emotions under control. then take whatever amount of testing money you want to play with and go nuts. but be extremely conscious about wehat you are doing.",2021-02-10 06:32:09,2021-02-10,-0.6698

That said, most of the securities I buy are not super volatile (other than what transpired 2 weeks ago) and it's very unlikely for say, an 80% gain on AAPL or 100% gain on SQ to be erased quickly. 

My idea is look at how you think the company is doing. Do you think it is doing well and will continue to do so in the future? If not, is there another company that you think is a better investment? Also, don't try to time peaks and troughs. Nobody knows when the top is going to be. As long as you can answer the above questions and are satisfied with your gains, then sell. Conversely, if you think a stock will grow in value in the long-term, then buy. A fluctuation of +/- 10% in the short-term is not a big deal if it grows by a lot more in the long-term.

if you buy stocks of ""healhy"" companies, you cannot really do anything wrong, except when you are. Kostolany (might want to look him up if you never heard that name) famously said  
""best advice for investors is to buy stocks of good, large and healthy companies and then take sleeping pills. when you wake up, you will be surprised by how much money you made"".  
   
statistically and historically the market always went up and always recovered to even higher highs after a crash / downturn. 

so, time is really on any ones side.

the only thing that differs wildly is the amount of return people can / will achieve.   
here¬¥s a few more stats:   
success rate of daytraders seems to be around 10-20% max.   
yes they can wildly outperform the market, but few ever do. 

realistic return rates for stock based portfolios (again long term view) seem to be around 9-13% annualy. you MIGHT get lucky and get more , but expecting this happen every year is simply unrealistic. 

most retail investors actually lose money by chasing unrealistic returns.

they hop on hypes too late, sell too late, hold on to losers for too long and do not have a REAL risk-management and exit strategy.   
it is true that currently it seems that investing is super easy. but actively trading and choosing what to buy and what to sell and at what time consistently day / month in and out is actually pretty hard.   
even the best performing ETF¬¥s do not make perfect choices in their investments all the time. yet they are much better at spreading risk, and maximizing the chance to be ""right"" about their investments. 

I do trade stocks and ""try"" to beat the market. but I have to admit, the best returns I have made so far where either surefire companies (think AAPL, MSFT, GOOG) , surefire companies too big to fail that got hit by a pandemic (XOX, BP, CVX) , or ETF¬¥s.",2021-02-09 07:37:02,2021-02-09,0.9884

Lastly for some strong dividend returns, I went with O (Realty Income) which pays monthly and has only ever increased payments over time. CCI and ABBV also post strong dividends annually.

KOS to me seemed like a yolo buy the dip while their value continues to rise and they pay dividends as well.

I currently have 25 GME and 120 AMC that I plan on holding regardless but do not plan to invest further until I see less volatile news and the memes die down.

with that logic my list is not so different from the one above... my long term top 5 are probable AAPL, AMD, PINS, SQ, and ABNB

AAPL - Awesome business model, great managament and very good finances. They are very diversified with the products and services that they sell and the EV stuff has incredible potential.

MSFT - From Windows to a diversified tech juggernaut. one of the key reasons I like them so much is the fact that they‚Äôre competing in so many areas. Gaming, personal computing, consumer tech, Office 365 and of course the nest egg Azure. Brilliant finances and I‚Äôm very confident when I give money to Nadella‚Äôs hands. 

DIS - Another good long term play. Still recovering from COVID, but it won‚Äôt be a big problem in the long term. When the parks and cruises open, Disney is looking like a real snack. Disney+ will make a ton of money for them and make them an even more diversified in the entertainment business. Will always remain a big part of American pop culture.

V - The absolute leader in the payment market. Clear leader and they pretty much have a duopoly with MA. Profits will get even better as we move to a more cashless world. They‚Äôre also staying innovative and they really want to push to the crypto and fintech markets even more. They are also a recovery play as a lot of their revenue got knocked out because of the pandemic.

JNJ - I feel very safe when I hold JNJ. The biggest pharma giant in the world builds them a very nice moat. Great margins as expected from the pharma business and a experienced management. The other company alongside Micorsoft with a credit rating of AAA which tells that they have good finances. Dividend is very steady and healthcare is very recession proof.

Look at the APR for borrowing GME shares. 2 weeks ago, the borrow APR was 80%, so anyone shorting was bleeding money while holding onto shorts. That APR has now dropped to 3.7%, likely because shorts covered and made shares more accessible to lenders.

If you multiply all of those together, one share of Apple stock from 1980 would have split into 224 of today‚Äôs shares. At it‚Äôs current price of $136.76/share, that single share would be worth 224x136.76 = $30,634.24. On the day of their IPO the share price opened at $20, or adjusted for inflation, $62.82. Some people were lucky enough to get it at that price, but most weren‚Äôt. The share price skyrocketed that day, hitting $30 at its absolute peak. Adjusted for inflation, that‚Äôs $94.23/share.

TGT. I shop there all the time since the pandemic. 

NTDOY. My girlfriend and I bought a switch. She‚Äôs also into Pok√©mon, so this gets me some exposure to that

UPWK. I‚Äôve been using this platform to make extra money during the pandemic. I‚Äôve made a lot more investing in them than offering services through them, though. 

REAL. One of my gfs favorite shopping sites. I have no doubt that as the world reopens, there‚Äôs going to be a surge of purchases as people get decked out for the office again. 

I bought BAC and T because I have as using their services. I‚Äôve since dropped att wireless for Comcast yet continue to own this. I keep telling myself to sell. Hasn‚Äôt worked. Lol. 

eBay. Being locked in, I‚Äôve spent more time looking to fill out old collections, mostly vinyl records. Saw their share price relative to earnings and thought this was a great opportunity. Doing well so far, they just increased their dividend. But time will tell. 

Others are work driven. Despite all the hype about AMD, only one user at work as requested a thread ripper machine. Everyone else asks for and gets Intel. Intel makes buckets of cash, I have a lot of faith that they‚Äôll catch up again in part by deploying that money. 

ESTC. Another work related one. Just started dabbling with their tools and am pretty happy so far. I‚Äôm a bit worried that right after I invested, Amazon forked the project though. So that needs some reevaluation now.

393,"&gt; proceed to answer my question as if I‚Äôm paying you to do so, thanks

My uncle always told me, ""advice is only as good as the price you pay for it,"" so keep that in mind. 

From what I can tell, the current replies to this comment are actually incorrect. For a profitable trade, the price of the underlying does not need to move above the break even, and similarly for puts, the price does not need to move below the break even. 

There are multiple characteristics of options, such as theta, vega, delta, and gamma, also known as ""the greeks"". The price of an option contract is dependent on these values. Let's take vega for example, which measures an option's sensitivity to implied volatility. 

Imagine we purchase a call option on Apple with a strike date that is one year away, thus creating a LEAP position. LEAPs are naturally long vega, so as volatility increases, so does the price of the option. So, while the price of the underlying ($AAPL) could remain flat, if implied volatility increases, so will the price of the option contract. As a result, you could sell for a profit despite the stock never moving.",2021-02-05 20:19:40,2021-02-05,0.9274

401,"Posted this on another thread but,

It really depends. There are some stocks whereby I am able to tell myself to hold for years and ignore the short term movements and not take a single cent in profit (e.g NET avg $38 and MWK avg ~$20 after averaging up) because I absolutely trust the company to do well and is a market disruptor. 

There are some whereby I got taken by surprise and sold a portion to get back my cost after it ran up too high (e.g. NIO (bought at $15 when it wasn‚Äôt super meme and CHWY (I love this stock but the current valuation is a little out of my expected range)

Then there are some where you expect it to be a great long term stock but it blew up due to some catalyst. I actually bought BBBY after their last ER, it was a no brainer. 2.2b cash and equivalent but 2.6b market cap, with positive earnings and a great new leadership. Immediate buy. Didn‚Äôt think it ended up getting a part of the short squeeze and I sold at high 40s because I don‚Äôt think BBBY is worth double what I got it for. Am also not interested in investing in a company for ‚Äòshort squeeze potential‚Äô, this will hurt a lot of people in the long term. If investing was as easy as finding shorted companies and buying them, everyone would be rich.

I somewhat dislike the saying to take profits on ur winners and scale a certain %. If it was a true stock that will grow in years, you should not touch a single share and even average up if you can. I have absolute faith that NET and MWK will continue to be profitable in the next few years and will not sell a single share. 

The smarter thing to do (in my opinion) is to sell your non-conviction losers. Selling your winners and holding on to your losers is akin to plucking the flowers and watering the weeds in your garden. 

Seriously when you come back to certain stocks a few years later, you will be glad you held on. I had AAPL at 130 pre-split and I never bothered to look at it before.",2021-02-05 17:15:58,2021-02-05,0.9973

TSM
QCLN
DKNG
MJ

I want to get like 3K in each of my holdings before picking up another stock (thinking something a bit more ""safer"" but that can still grow like AAPL or MSFT)?

Does that sound sane?",2021-02-05 16:46:26,2021-02-05,0.854
403,"As my previous post was removed (I'm still not sure why), I'll make changes and try again....

**QQQM** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. QQQM is the ""new QQQ."" It is essentially the same ETF, but with a lower expense ratio. I don't know why more people aren't talking about it on here, but use this one instead of QQQ if you are a new investor. If you already have money in QQQ, I'd say keep using that one, because there isn't enough difference between the two to make it worth paying taxes on selling QQQ to buy QQQM.

Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. Top holdings are: AAPL (12.5%), MSFT (9.5%), AMZN (8.7%), and TSLA (5.4%). Since it is heavily weighted on fewer stocks than some ETFs, it's performance is more dependent on these tech stocks. That said, these are pretty good stocks with a history of good performance. AAPL and AMZN have both had recent and significant price target increases from a number of brokers. The 52 week performance for QQQ is 45%, which is phenomenal for a broad market ETF.

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index, the main difference being that VOO has a slightly lower expense ratio. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. Because there are 500 stocks and because there is more balance, this fund tends to be less volatile than QQQ. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist. Top Holdings include: AAPL (6.7%), MSFT (5.3%), AMZN (4.3%), FB (2.8%) and TSLA (1.7%). The 52 week performance is a respectable 17%. I think the average over long periods of time is around 7% annually.

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. The 52 week performance is 13%.

**VTV** \- The Vanguard Value Index Fund, as you mentioned, is a passively managed ETF tracking the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index. Top holdings in this one include BRK/B (2.9%), JNJ (2.8%), JPM (2.7%), PG (2.4%), UNH (2.3%). The 52 week return on VTV is 2.93%. Total returns including dividends is 4.06%. VTV has two goals: Dividend income and to reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs.

**LIT** \- Global Lithium Battery ETF. This is a sector ETF that is passively managed and follows a lithium production and manufacturing index. The 52 week performance is a whopping 110%.

**POTX** \- A cannibis ETF that invests at least 80% of its total assets in the securities of the underlying index and in American Depositary Receipts (""ADRs"") and Global Depositary Receipts (""GDRs"") based on the securities in the underlying index. The 52 week return is 26%, but I suspect a lot of people think that will be much higher this year.

(Note: I'm not a financial advisor or a financial expert)

Here is what I have proposed in the past, and I think it's a good strategy for ETF investing:

20% - Broad market ETF of your choice: **QQQM**, **VOO**, etc. I would avoid **VTV** if you are under age 40. It's a little too conservative for younger investors; the growth potential isn't there. If you are over age 40, you may want to split this portion of your allocation and put 10% into **QQQM** or **VOO** and 10% into **VTV**.

20% - **VXUS** \- I think it's a good idea to put some money into an emerging markets fund, and in my past research this one looks to be one of the better funds for this purpose.

20% - Small or Mid-cap market fund. Here is one you didn't mention. I think a broad market fund that focuses on either small-cap or mid-cap companies is a good idea for any portfolio, especially if you are under age 40. **IWM** is one of my favorites in this area. IWM is an passively managed index fund that tracks the Russell 2000 index, investing in 2000 small-cap companies in the US equity market.

10% into each of four sector funds of your choice. For example:

10% - LIT

10% - POTX

10% - ARKG

10% - PBW

430,"BRK is similar to an S&amp;P ETF in the sense that you are in a sense purchasing a stake in multiple companies and brands. However it is different in many other ways: 

1. While BRK is invested in a lot of companies it is still way less than 500.

2. BRK is more concentrated. At least 23% of their current market cap is in AAPL stock and another 14% is split between BAC, KO, AXP, KHC. 

3. BRK is actively managed rather than passively like an index fund

4. A good portion of their company (roughly half give or take) is an actual conglomerate that makes products, provides services, and has actual revenue and overhead and employees and all the other things that a company has. If you take a look at all the brands that Berkshire owns fully there will definitely be a few that make you think, ""Holy shit I had no idea that that was them!""",2021-02-04 21:31:33,2021-02-04,0.5355

A lot of growth of the S&amp;P 500, even with the growth/tech companies, wasn't earnings growth, but multiple expansion.  My whole point was that while all other companies are expanding their multiples, BRK seems to be immune from that and remains cheap relative to earnings. It seems the premium for growth potential is getting larger and larger.

434,"I hope this‚Äôll be my last piece on the $GME affair.

**Alright, where do I begin?**

I noticed something being really odd when Robinhood started allowing more shares from GameStop to be purchased. I looked at the graph, compared it to the Volkswagen graph, and thought to myself ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù. I was wondering if anyone on \/r/WallStreetBets brought this up, but I don‚Äôt think I found anything.

It looked just like the squeeze, and it already happened. Starting from January 26 to the start of February, that‚Äôs the five days. What did we do during this squeeze? We held. We gave the big guys a way out, and a whole weekend to plan.

So how did this happen? Well, misinformation. The subreddit knew it was being infiltrated by bots, but what we didn‚Äôt account for was that this behavior could easily be observed by newcomers. Eventually, it assimilated, and it worked.

**Where was the turning point?**

Easy, it was January 27, the day Robinhood stopped shares from being purchased. It was evil. It was genius. There‚Äôs nothing like getting your shorts covered more than artificially limiting the price. 

This did three things:

1) It gave two (and only two) choices to stockholders: sell or hold. If the halt didn‚Äôt happen, we‚Äôd have been seeing posts like ‚ÄúThe squeeze is being squoze,‚Äù ‚ÄúDiamond hands, it‚Äôs time.‚Äù But wait! Only the sell button works! It inadvertedly creates the idea of doing what they *want* you to do, instead of doing the actual smart thing: reap your profits. It discouraged selling when it was the perfect time.

2) It allowed the market holders to excercise their short buy-backs without being the center of attention. 

3) It was the perfect avenue to introduce misinformation. ‚ÄúWe set our prices,‚Äù ‚Äú$69,420 is not a meme,‚Äù ‚Äúisthesqueezesquoze.com‚Äù.

**What‚Äôs going on now?**

Well, now the subreddit‚Äôs main moderators have been kicked out. With a bunch of new people in the financial sector, it‚Äôll be invaluable to have a group of people be on the lookout for the next $VW. 

Unfortunately, I think it‚Äôs too late. People like me got in when the price was high and fell. People with college grants. People with life savings. People that made loans.

It‚Äôll be easier for them to hold onto the share than to sell it, because that‚Äôs their cash, and most of us can‚Äôt accept that some thousand dollars are now gone. The money could‚Äôve gone to a computer, or a car, a new phone, but instead it disappeared into stocks, into the pockets of a billionaire.

If there‚Äôs another short squeeze, it won‚Äôt be coming anytime soon. This was a psychological battle, and they won.

**So, what‚Äôs next?**

Well, I‚Äôm gonna accept my losses. I gambled in the casino called Wall Street, and lost. That‚Äôs okay though, and if you gambled, hope you‚Äôre cool too.

Technology‚Äôs incredible. Who knew we could make bets and lose them all in the comfort of our own homes?

I‚Äôm going to put the money I do have left into some non-meme stocks. Some prime candidates for me that I saw recommended on this subreddit are GOEV (electric vehicle company) and MRVL (transistors, plus 5G). I was also thinking big companies like AAPL, but that‚Äôs definitely for security and safety.

I‚Äôm also gonna go back to DoorDashing sometime soon. I still gotta make up for my big loss, and save back up for when I move out. Farewell, GameStop.",2021-02-04 20:45:14,2021-02-04,0.9963

439,"I think a big issue we still haven't addressed with self driving cars is legislature. And government moves slowly. So even in the case that's true TSLA has a ton of risk involved. Which is why it'd be better if people were paying the price it's worth *now* instead of building a bubble for the future lol. That bubble may never be filled and all it takes is, say, a small political move to burst it. 

Also, I just don't think batteries and self driving sortware are a trillion dollar industry on their own. Think of companies worth that much - AMZN, GOOGL, WMT, AAPL, etc.

Is Amazon worth a trillion because of *just* its book store? No. Is Apple worth a trillion because of *just* their iPhone/iPod legacy? No. It's because they cover dozens of different markets with a diverse list of products. 

Unless TSLA expands their brand there's no way it'll ever fulfill the kind of value people talk about in a time line that's realistic. If they're just a battery and software and car company they'll only hold so much market dominance for so long.

479,"I'm happy to give you a walk-through! To sell a covered call, you will need 100 shares of a stock that has options enabled for it. The basic premise for selling a call is this: you receive a premium up-front and pick a price point and an expiration. Until the end of expiration day, the person who bought your option has the right to buy your 100 shares at the agreed price. 

An example: 

* I have 100 shares of BB, which I bought for an average price of $11. I will sell a covered call, choosing this Friday at $12 strike price. For this contract, I receive $55 premium (paid up front). 

* If by end of Friday, BB is $12 or more, I will be asked to sell the 100 shares at $12. Since I bought them at $11 and sold at $12, I will get +$100 for the sale. Since I also received a $55 premium up front, the total profit is +$155. 

* If by end of Friday, BB is &lt;$12, then the option expires. I keep my 100 shares and the $55. In effect, I am paid $55 for the week (i.e. the passive income). 

* While the option is present, I can't sell the 100 shares, since they are tentatively promised to someone else (if they want to buy it from me). In effect, they are collateral. 

As long as the strike price (the offered selling price) is higher than the purchase price for the 100 shares, I will always make a profit, even if I have to sell. Otherwise, I just receive the passive income, and come next Monday, sell another covered call. If I did end up selling, I get the money and can buy 100 shares of a stock (the same or something else) and sell another covered call. 

With this covered call strategy, you have two major risk points: 

1) The price rises far above your strike price. Since you agreed to sell it at a set price, you will lose all potential profits above that price. Your max profit is capped at the strike price profit from your purchase price, and the premium earned. 

2) The stock price drops below your purchase price. In that case, your original investment has lost some value (some of which can be offset by your premium gain). If the company goes bankrupt, then you of course lose your entire initial investment, so it pays to choose wisely which stock you are comfortable holding 100 shares of. 

3) This strategy can work for blue-chip stocks (your AAPL, MSFT, etc.) that are exceedingly safe. A safe stock will give you fairly little by way of premiums however, but if you are already holding a large amount of them you can put them to work and make a little extra. AAPL for example will cost you $13,500 today to get 100 shares, and the weekly option is about $216 for next week (roughly 1.6%). Compare this to a highly volatile stock like BB, which will get you closer to 6% per week (but given how quickly the price can tank, there's a reason for that!).

4) Premiums are treated as taxable income, so don't forget about the tax implications!

Hope that introduction helps! Happy to answer any follow-up questions you may have.

482,"""Looking for long-term"" and ""is now the time"" are two completely contradictory strategies. If you have decided that holding AAPL is a suitable part of your long-term portfolio, the time is always now, until you reach the holding size you're looking for. Whatever definition you have of ""long-term,"" it should include a minimum of 12 months (ideally 36-360). At that point, the price will be somewhere between 250-500, and you won't care if you bought at 134, even though you could have gotten in for 132.75 if you had only waited two more days. 

If you're looking to time the market and swing trade, find something more volatile.

483,"Yea if you are trading on the NYSE you need to do it in USD. If you are making a trade from your Canadian account, every time you buy or sell, you are going from CAD to USD or vice versa. So you buy 100 shares of AAPL, it will cost you X per share plus 1.5% conversion fee plus 9.99 commission. When you sell the 100 shares, you get money in your CAD account but you will get nailed with another 1.5% conversion fee.

One way around this is to open a USD trade account with TD. You can put a lump sum in there and get the 1.5% charge once, but once it's in there, you can buy/sell as much as you want and won't get conversion fees (you still pay commission though).

For quick trades like if I hold for a few days to take advantage of swings, I use Wealthsimple for their no commission structure. They also have the same currency conversion charge so I tend to do it more in the TSX.",2021-02-04 01:29:50,2021-02-04,0.6808

Yes. There are single digit trades at either open or close of different tickers. GME has them at the beginning, AAPL has them at the end. The AAPL small chunks happen from exactly 4pm for 2 minutes, the GME small chunks happen for exactly 60 seconds at open.

I can't pretend to know what decides whether a ticket has the lower volumes at the beginning or end. Nor do I work for NASDAQ, but I do work in data, and I'd be willing to bet that the reason for the brief window of low volume trades is due to the sorting algorithm not having enough time or batches to sort the trades into 100s.

So I understand the Greeks and how they influence each other for the most part, but one thing that has eluded me is how vega changes with volatility. I know that vega goes down with time, and that vega represents the dollar change per percentage change in the IV.

My question pertains to AAPL calls. AAPL has incredibly low volatility right now. I believe that AAPL has found its bottom, as it has bounced off of 119 repeatedly while the rest of tech continues to drop. I believe that it will return to the 125-135 range between now and the end of April. 

Trading sideways for a week and a half has caused IV to die down to around 30% on most options. I'm looking to buy some june/July calls while IV is super low and I think the price has bottomed out, then sell into the IV spike when earnings come at the end of April. The last two earnings IV hit about 60% on AAPL. My option I'm eying has a vega of 15, we'll say it drops to 10 by earnings. That would imply that an increase in 30 points in IV would spike the options price by 300$. 

I know that's too good to be true, and that IV going up has some effect on vega, but I don't know how much. How can I figure this out, and also, is my reasoning sound as far as getting the options now while IV is dead and selling into the pre-earnings IV? Is there anywhere to calculate what a 30% increase in IV would actually do? Would greatly appreciate the help!",2021-03-31 01:52:09,2021-03-31,0.7225

To get long TSLA, I would like to see what happens in a real bear market or deep correction. If TSLA reaches a low point and bottoms out before the indices, I think it's a solid buy. AAPL AMZN did the same thing during 2008 and it led to a full decade of solid returns.

27,"&gt; It's almost a certainty that all cars will go electric, and a certainty that batteries will be the big deciding factor on who wins. VW and Tesla are the only contenders in the western world; nobody else is thinking about where to get their batteries in 2025 and 2030.

You‚Äôre very misinformed. The market is getting more saturated by the day. By 2025, there will be an insane number of EVs in the marketplace. TSLA is already slowing down its growth in the face of VW, Ford, GM, Lucid, and Nio. Mercedes, Freightliner, and Volvo are just a few more that will zap more of their business. 

&gt; Plus Tesla has a few AWS-like revenue streams in development. They only need like 1-2 of them to succeed to be worth over 1-2 trillion.

And they‚Äôre still very theoretical and need perfect conditions to work, which Cathie apparently does not want to consider. 

&gt; The fact that most people don't know about Tesla's non car software potential makes Tesla an easy hold for me. Their physical car business is going to be tiny compared to everything else by 2030.

Investopedia: 
‚ÄúA wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar. It also happens if the individual sells the security at a loss, and their spouse or a company they control buys a substantially similar security within 30 days.‚Äù",2021-03-29 02:20:45,2021-03-29,0.1477

116,"I bought a 500 shares of TSLA during the current dip.  I am not concerned about VW at all.

I have a Porsche Cayenne S, 911S and a BMW.  They all have a few things in common, the electrical sucks, the plastic sucks.  The metal is great (engine and body).  That's the opposite of what EV needs.  I have no doubt that VW EV owners will have to replace the battery around 5-7 years of ownership.

Typical car companies save the newest features for the best model.   TSLA is not doing this (the Model Y has newer/better features than the model X).  I agree with this approach.

I've not met an actual TSLA owner that is pissed off because of the delay in FSD.  Infact, I've know more people w/o FSD than with.  That's great for TSLA.  By the time FSD gains traction, there will be a ton of vehicles w/o FSD hitting the used market.  All TSLA needs to do is adding FSD to those vehicles and turn them around for a 5-10k extra profit.

The current US electrical grid is not suitable for large scale EV adoption.  To level out the demand, whole house battery/solar system is needed, TSLA definitely has a horse in this race.

China is a very important market and TSLA is the AAPL of the Chinese EV market.  Sure there are tons of local brands phone with more features at a lesser price,  the iPhone still has great profit from the Chinese market.  Tesla will be the same - a #1 choice among the richer part of the population.  EU EVs will also share this richer population but w/o the benefit of a local factory.

Other smaller EV companies are just noise.  Things only get serious when AAPL and Toyota enter the market.

TSLA is also a b-i-t-c-o-i-n holding company.  While many people may thing it's a negative,  I think it's a good thing for the company.  it's not much different from McDonald is as much as real estate company as a fast food company.  It sets the low for the company values.


Most people would agree that last month TSLA has seen very significant drop.  Look at the data,  it's more than $10/week.  However I also lower my cost basis by $8-$10/week selling CC while waiting for the chip shortage to lift and the cyber truck to roll out.  Now if TSLA drops down to the $500 then I won't be able to sell CC at my original purchase price and may have to hold.  I'll worry about that when the time comes.

As far as specific stocks, I've always said one of the hardest things about stock trading is knowing what stocks are out there. I let the indexes sort out what stocks have legs from those that don't.

Trading &amp; investing will always be there and will always be subject to advancing technology. Algos will probably be more available for individual investors in 10yrs and things that I can't imagine will be out there as well.

126,"Warren's philosophy revolves around value investing and buying what you know. Warren doesn't know tech, and he knows that he doesn't.

Investing is all about risk management; how much risk are you taking on for a realistic reward? What happens if you lose a large portion of your money? I personally don't want to spend an extra five to ten years not retired because of a stupid mistake trying to double my money.

It's not as simple as buying Apple or Microsoft and earning 30% average per year. There were many years where they traded sideways or downwards. Look at Microsoft from 2001 to 2014. Thirteen years of doodoo in terms of equity appreciation. It can happen again.

Many of the companies you see popularized today will not be around in 5 to 10 years. For some reason it is popular to lose money and then try to go public.

I wouldn't hesitate to call myself a value investor. One of my ""top"" holdings is eBay. I don't expect for eBay to 10x overnight, but I do believe that it is fundamentally undervalued, and that it is an e-commerce/tech company that pays a dividend. I'll probably still be holding this company in 10 years, and my dividend yield on cost should be pretty juicy at that point, so long as they continue to up the dividend. eBay is also relatively recession proof, as people will continue to buy and sell on their platform no matter what the economy looks like, which brings risk down.

I'm long MSFT, AAPL and EBAY.

The price of the larger companies you mentioned has a lot to do with how much money they are making. IBM is still a fantastic company, but they don't raise their earnings by much. They have quite a bit of debt based on a quick look at finviz, and their dividend payout ratio looks like it is 103%, which is a little ""uh-oh"", as it means they are paying out more than they can afford to, putting their dividend at risk.

There are lots of value plays out there. I think Utz is a good value. WMT or TGT are arguably value companies.

188,"I 100% feel you on this. I had a very similar experience. I slowly grew my account over 6 months for 60% gains. Then all the gains were wiped out in 3 weeks. Easy come, easy go.

The biggest and most important thing I keep telling myself: its just money.

The first step of being emotionally detached from your investments is creating an aggregate networth and budgeting plan. A few key questions I use for myself:

* How much money do I have in the market via equities?

* How much money do I make from other income sources?

* If my equities go to zero and don't recover (ie. global catastrophic financial meltdown), how long will it take to get me back to where I am today?

* If my equities see an 80% drawdown (ie. 2001 dotcom, 2008 financial crisis), how long before I can get back to where I am using all income sources?

Creating budgeting strategies lets me sleep better at night. Because if I have a 60% drawdown in my trading portfolio, I know my net worth will only draw down by about 20% because of my aggregate financial asset allocation. And a 20% drawdown in net worth doesn't seem as scary as a 60% drawdown in net worth.

After you've done that, you need to create a manifesto. You need to write down why you're trading. All the existential reasons:

* What is your end goal of trading?

* When will you stop trading?

* How much money is considered ""life changing"" so you have financial independence?

Once you've created your manifesto, now write down your trading strategy and start keeping a log. Restrict yourself aggressively if you know you have weak determination (I do...so I have to be very strict with myself). Here are some trading strategies to get started:

* How many total stocks do you want to own? When I first started out, I didn't want to own more than 10. But I realized that even that was too much, so I pared that back to 5 to get my bearings. Over time I slowly grew that to 10 total stocks. If I ever want to buy a new stock, I force myself to drop an existing stock and make a justified reason as to why I'm buying a new ticker and replacing an existing ticker.

* What is the reason you bought the stock? Is this a momentum trade? If yes, what is your entry/exit points. WRITE IT DOWN. Force yourself to exit when you have written down the entry/exits. Don't try to squeeze every extra dollar. Don't worry if you missed a second pump. Don't hold garbage that tanks after bad news. Is this a conviction trade? Then buy and hold. And when you make more money, buy more. Companies like AAPL, MSFT, AMZN are all conviction trades. You buy and keep accumulating because you have faith they'll keep growing. And there are more volatile conviction trades. I'm a big believer in NET, I think they're putting out amazing products and will 3x in the next 5 years. I'm continuing to add to my position in NET whenever there is a drawdown. I consider NET currently trading at &lt; $70 to be a steal if I zoom out and look at 5 year time horizons. Some people feel the same way about IPOE (SOFI), others about ABNB, and I think TSLA was the biggest conviction trade historically.

* What is your tax implication? When you sell, you have to pay the tax man. How will you store all your proceeds, carve out tax burden and reinvest your earnings?

* How do you handle macro market events? Do you set stop losses? Do you keep extra kindling to buy into dips? Do you just set and forget? You need a strategy that lets you sleep at night. Also, what about the opposite? If you bought a stock and it hits your price target well ahead of schedule. What do you do then? Do you pare back your investment? Do you double down? You need to understand these impacts so you can properly balance your money.

What works for me is writing things down and going back and reading them once a week before I do anything to my portfolio. Without writing things down, you won't commit to a strategy. And write them down on paper. There is a social psychological impact of writing down your convictions with a pen on paper. It reinforces it stronger into your brain and holds you more accountable.",2021-03-26 11:57:38,2021-03-26,0.8923

QCOM is solid,  all the companies that deal with them hate the way they sell IP separately from chips and can therefore sell chips at a discount. However,  QCOM survived all the court challenges and have the only functioning 5G capability after IBM dropped out. When AAPL capitulated they signed a five year contract (going off memory here because it's late).  They are very powerful and make money,  lots and lots of money. 

Risks, well,  now that all the legal stuff is settled and they have long term contracts and are the undisputed leader in mobile tech, all that is priced in,  why would it do anything other than go up slowly paying a pittance for dividends (was 5% before).  

Also,  medium term,  IBM could make a better 5G chip (haha), or AAPL could make their own chips ( after the contract expires because they're well-known for making chips haha).

I bought my first set of shares in March of 2015 when their CEO made comments about starting to look at ways to cut costs (this is a normal part of every other business,  but They make too much money to care before that) so the last risk is that they don't have an culture of cost control and the stress is gone.   I held onto a double sized position until after the last earnings call when they didn't raise the dividend.   Dividends impose discipline.

The market is rotating away from your positions and you are taking some losses and pain. It‚Äôs temporary.

You can beat yourself up for a day and learn the lesson the market is teaching you, but only for a day. And then it is back to work. 

Again I trade stocks and options. The beauty of options is that they expire which forces you to make another decision. 

I normally buy 100 shares of a stock so I can sell a Covered Call. Or in the case of AAPL I sold a cash secured put at a strike price of 117.5 for a premium of $2.82 so I am offering to buy AAPL at $117.50 which is less than it is. I want to buy it at a discount.

I‚Äôm up $62 on that option trade right now so I can close that trade right now and I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm looking for $150 on that trade.

212,"Your broker pass through the cost from the lender to you. 
If you want to short 1 share of apple stock from let‚Äôs say RH...well RH essentially calls up a prime broker like JPM. JPM can lend you that share they charge a borrow fee. JPM charges RH 3MonthFedOpen+80bps. Today that rate is at 0.10, so RH pays 0.90%. Naturally RH charges you 1.20% for their effort. You pay 1.20/360 =0.003% for 1 day.  This rate tend to reset monthly. Next month the rate may jump to 0.20 then next month now you pay 1.3% annualized. 

It all depends on what you‚Äôre trying to borrow. AAPL as a blue chip is likely most liquid so A prime broker charges the lowest. Even if you go to a stock on the russell2000 the borrow rate jumps from FedOpen+80 to FedOpen+120. 
Now if you are trying to short something that everyone wants to short or they just don‚Äôt issue so many shares (hard to borrow list) then the cost of borrow is even higher. 

The true details on how it‚Äôs calculated is not public. It‚Äôs the contract between your broker and the various prime brokers. Each broker may have different rates. I would imagine if you are with Merril (they are their own PB) borrow rate would be cheaper.",2021-03-25 23:05:31,2021-03-25,0.2766

223,"The first one is true as long as what you're buying is solid. If you're buying overvalued meme shit, then timing the market becomes necessary.

But when it comes to passive investing, or well diversified, well researched active investing, in the long run, the first one is true.

And by long run I mean many years, not a couple months. If you look back at the last 30 years there's a LOT of spots where you could've ""bought the peak"" and been red for months/years. But every index and all quality stocks are up massively overall. And if you had tried to buy every dip and sell every peak there is a 99% chance that your overall returns would be lower than if you just kept buying whenever you had money and holding.

BUT along those years, there is countless stocks that rose to ATH and never came back. People who bought the peak on those never broke even. The dotcom bubble comes to mind, and is what is most similar to the current environment IMO. So many overvalued bullshit companies (the EV space in current years comes to mind), and if you timed them well you could've made huge gains, but if you didn't you were left holding the bag forever.

But now if you look at the quality companies of the time, even tech companies, in the end you come out a winner. Look at MSFT for example. If you bought at the peak of the dotcom bubble, it was 59$. It stayed under there for 16 years. But it's a solid company, and in the long run it ended up outperforming every index over the same period. And normally you would keep buying at regular intervals so you would've broke even much sooner than 2016, and the returns today would be much better.

This ended up very long, but what I'm getting at is both statements can be true from the same perspective. You want to identify solid companies, that you have strong belief will outperform the market for many many years, and you want to continuously buy them regularly, and only sell if your thesis has changed and you don't believe in their future anymore. Buying ""overvalued"" stocks isn't necessarily bad, as long as they're not excessively overvalued, and the company is solid (stocks like aapl and amzn come to mind as fitting that description).

237,"&gt; but I do disagree with people who are okay with losing capital.

Their logic is beyond my understanding. However that‚Äôs dividend investing to most people. They don‚Äôt care about anything besides dividend income. 


This is the problem I have with dividend growth investing. People will often say ‚Äúdividend growth stocks out preform the market, that‚Äôs why I do dividend investing.‚Äù Which is true, dividend growth stocks do tend to outperform the market. Well the issue I have is often these dividend growth stocks have other factors that explain their growth in value, it‚Äôs not due to the dividend. If you take a profitable company, with a growing revenue...like duh the share price will appreciate. It‚Äôs no different than investing in good solid growing companies for capital appreciation, however they contribute their returns to dividends. Which imho is the wrong way to think, but at least they aren‚Äôt advocating the loss of capital as a viable strategy for long term returns....so I‚Äôm fine with it. 


Ima pick on Joseph Carlson because he‚Äôs popular on YouTube and I actually like some of his videos. You can see his shift from dividends to growth. Yet he claims he only cares about dividend income. Well, when Disney cut their dividend, he bought more because he wants capital appreciation lmao, which goes against his entire investment strategy that he preaches. You can also see where he forgets dividend income when it comes to bonds, he claims that ‚Äúbonds yields are just too low.‚Äù Well....AGG has a yield of 2.68%, and his largest holding is Apple which has a yield of 0.68%. So he refuses to buy bonds because they don‚Äôt pay enough in dividends, yet his largest holding pays significantly less. I understand he expects growth in AAPL‚Äôs dividend, but his justification is rather inadequate. I emailed him to explain further on why bonds don‚Äôt pay enough but Apple does and he has never replied or responded to my email. Imo it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs starting to realize capital appreciation is king. 



When it comes to Dividend Irrelevancy. I used to be a denier too. It wasn‚Äôt until I sat down and read academic research and really sought understanding of it that I realized it‚Äôs real. The problem, and this is why many deny it, is there‚Äôs no perfect example to compare a dividend stock and a non dividend stock.

256,"I lost plenty of money when I was young too, but at least you have Reddit forums to learn from.  It's good that you don't play with options.  Stick with shares when you're starting out.  I separate my investing to 2 categories.

1. long term investing.  For these, you need to do DD to determine what you believe the company is worth.  That way even if the stock price fall, you just keep holding it because it's worth more than what people are willing to pay you for.  Suppose you believe AAPL is worth $140 and you buy at $120, then you'd just keep holding until someday it hits $140.
2. trading aka gambling.  GME and RKT would fall into this category.  For these, you should gamble only an amount you're comfortable with losing.  If you're lucky and turn an unrealized profit, you should set an exit price you're happy with and not worry about maximizing your profit.  It's impossible to predict how much they will go up and down.  I generally set 20% profit goal for stocks I'm doing short term gambling on.  Let's say you're ahead in Texas Hold'em after the flop, but your opponents have many outs.  You should be happy to bet and have everyone fold so you can take the profit right there instead of trying to maximize your winning but risk losing the hand.  The same apply to gambling stocks.  Oftentimes it's better to just take a guaranteed profit than trying to squeeze out more gains.

Would you keep holding in February 2022 if all the growth, tech, ARK you just bought at the literal top in Feb 2021 still happened to gain 25% in one year?

If this perfectly mirrors last year, we should see some upside very soon. Conversely, lots of people might continue selling and locking in their gains from buying the covid dip through April and May, prolonging any rebound for months.

If a stock has little volume and trading activity, the ""gaps"" between each of those buys or sells, could be dollars instead of pennies.. Also market orders may very dangerous! Liquidity and volume makes prices sane. If you lack volume then the gaps in market orders can get out of hand quickly.

302,"""Tech Wreck"" started last month on overvaluation concerns with peak Feb 9-12. Then, selling in tech sector and then small caps and Russell 2000 and midcaps being sold off - same concerns.  The bottom was hit Mar 4-5. Then, there was a very weak rebound, and now the retest. As of today the Nasdaq is holding above it's early Mar lows, but the Russell 2K is at the lows. The Dow and S&amp;P are also above their early Mar lows. The small cap 600s and midcaps have been stellar winners for a year, along with the ""smart"" ETFs - including the ARK funds. Seems like TSLA began to stall in the mid 800's, then slowly began to fall, and this took the rest of the tech stocks along. AAPL peaked in the low 140's then faded. The next few days are critical. IF the Russell 2k can't hold it's early March lows, and the QQQs break to new lows then we may be in for some additional selling. The only sector that is showing some life is the semiconductors. There is a worldwide shortage of chips and good news from Intel. Still, that sector has been in some pain in recent days as well. All of my best technical trading systems are OUT now. This isn't as bad as last March, but it is certainly a big correction. The tech stocks  do drop 20-40% every once in a while, but they always come back - eventually. The buy and hold crowd just takes this in stride. Like you, and most here, I took a portfolio value drop after early Feb, then had a partial rebound, then back to new lows again.

But the thing is there are so many people trading that there will also be a plethora of market buyers and sellers for a stock like aapl. Every second or so there will be people placing market orders which means ""buy this for the cheapest I can"" or ""sell this as fast as possible to the highest bidder""

I understand your questions in your post , but the thing is there are so many transactions going on that it's hard to analyze like you are trying.

Rather, think of it this way. Millions of orders are entered into the system. Some market buys, some limit buys, some market sells, some limit sells. And then a giant software system runs the analysis and pairs buyers with sellers and determines which stocks exchange hands. It's too big of a system to work it through on paper and pencil.

If youve ever sold a large amount of stock at market you'll see this in action. Sell like 500 shares of AAPL and you'll see ""37 executed at 200, 28 executed at 199.6, 62 executed at 199.2"" etc. You're basically pacman ""eating"" the buys on the way down.

308,"Long story short there are different types of orders when you buy a stock. For example if you buy at market there‚Äôs some wiggle room in the price and is executed at the quickest time of delivery, but your price isn‚Äôt entirely locked in. Limit orders you set your price floor or ceiling and are put into a transaction queue until the underlying value gets to that point. Generally brokers will protect you to match your order with the closest available one. 

So let‚Äôs say you try to buy a single share of AAPL at $200, you‚Äôll likely just get on the first available purchase order that meets sufficient volume to execute. You won‚Äôt pay $200, but I wouldn‚Äôt make it a practice of it. This could become a VERY dangerous practice if you were to buy in large volumes on a smaller less active share. The ticker reflects the last transaction price. If demand is low and price comes down to meet supply it‚Äôs red and vice versa. If the price were precisely $200 and you bought for $200 nothing would change. Changes reflect a differential in what‚Äôs being paid and what‚Äôs asked.

**TLDR** At a very fundamental level a stock‚Äôs price is really only driven by supply and demand.

There‚Äôs a lot of interesting theory behind it depending on your interest in mathematics and statistics. A lot of the terms thrown out so often now, &lt;insert squeeze or sell off here&gt; are just edge cases of extreme activity of limit demands and supply. This is why I‚Äôve found GameStop interesting as an example. Theoretically there‚Äôs a limit to any share value relative to the underlying equity, growth, implied risk, sentiment, and any other factor. Then if you abstract it a bit to a buyer and seller level this changes at an entirely different level since many people are deterred by a stock like Berkshire or Amazon with high cost. 

As an example of a completely recalled estimate I made a few weeks ago so numbers won‚Äôt be perfect. At $350 a share and around 70m in outstanding shares with ~$6.5bn in revenue GME‚Äôs market cap to revenue ratio was 3.79. As a contrast, Amazon is around $3.1k with around 440 million shares floating (which don‚Äôt rotate as often) and $386.1bn in revenue so a ratio of around 3.526. Effectively GME was more valued than Amazon without any of the intrinsics. When people boast pipe dreams and expectations of $1000+ this is why I found it interesting that people valued a company well beyond that ratio. There are definitely other factors, but at it‚Äôs core I find that to be an indicator of a price limit. Nobody looking solely at business expectations and growth prospects would value the two companies equally.",2021-03-25 00:34:26,2021-03-25,0.9978

MSFT's OS is always a new face on an existing crappy underlying foundation.  I looked in C:\\Windows\\System and found exes in there from the Windows 3.1 days.  In July 1981 Microsoft bought all rights to 86-DOS, otherwise known as QDOS, for Quick and Dirty Operating System, from Seattle Computer Products for $50,000 or $75,000.  They got a buggy, crappy operating system that they've continually upgraded up to this point.  But the internals are still the same buggy, crappy, barely functional foundation that was made to work just in the nick of time.  Also the heterogeneous hardware support gives you all sorts of unpredictable software behavior since there could be existing third party driver bugs introduced in OS operation making Windows an unpredictable nightmare to run.

AAPL's OSX was based on OPENSTEP NexTSTEP 10 years of operating system design.  Solid foundation.   Restricted hardware.  Predictability.   OS functions per spec and does what it's supposed to do.

348,"I'm not sure if you do this, but a lot of people buy stock in a company solely because of price movement, without any correlation to technicals, fundamentals, news, or solid research. It's easy to lose continually when you don't have preset rules for why you buy a stock. Buying Blue Chip stocks is usually not a bad idea, but often they fluctuate like anything else for a reason. Some people/companies/institutions trade when news hits, good or bad. Others trade due to technical analysis of support levels, buy indicators, etc. Others buy because they do tons of research on a company and decide that the company is worth the current market value. If you are doing none of the 3 things, and just buying thinking ""AAPL dropped 5% today! It must go back up 5% tomorrow!"" you will probably continually trade at the wrong time. 

Find a system that works for you. Personally my process usually goes like this:

\-Watch a company stock dip or rise a larger % than normal

\-Go check for news about company online

\-Do some basic research on their fundamentals (profit, earnings, revenue, etc.)

\-Decide if the stock is worth buying due to these factors. 

\-Check my Technical Charts (I use Ichimoku Cloud charts). If they indicate a strong buy in the timeframe I want then I purchase. If not I wait until they indicate a strong buy to purchase.",2021-03-24 17:11:57,2021-03-24,0.985

You have good tastes, but it‚Äôs nothing super edgy. Not a criticism at all, I just wonder if you‚Äôre benefiting by individual holdings with a balance like this. The more I think about it, the more I wonder if a couple of ETFs that fit your strategy wouldn‚Äôt be better.

I feel confident with this recommendation. I‚Äôm not going to tell you which ones ‚Äî there are countless ETFs out there that could fit your approach and do you well (again, ETF.com).

Really, your high risk comes in the form of big cap corrections. For example, Shopify, Twilio, and Square are all fantastic companies, but valuation is a huge question. Your gamble is not on whether they will take a jackhammer when it comes to carving a niche, it‚Äôs whether or not a jackhammer will be taken to their stock prices.

If you‚Äôre going to YOLO and do high risk, don‚Äôt roll the dice on another repeat of past performance. *Absolutely* keep your faith in most or all of these names, but you should be seeking out new risks.

Find a company that might slip under the radar and surprise Dorsey himself when it comes to accepting crypto payments. Or maybe there‚Äôs a small-cap beverage company that people who dig Pepsi will start reaching for when they grab a soda.

Remember, this is NORMAL. during the dot com bust spec stocks dropped over 80-90%. people are forgetting this.

412,"To answer you question, OP, these are block trades typically made by large hedge funds with terms agreed on well in advance and off the main exchanges.

It's possible that yesterday (or earlier) two funds agreed to exchange 3.5M AAPL shares (that's the volume I see on ToS) at precisely the Mar 22 opening price (or any other agreed-on price). This trade could happen any time (including after hours), but it's not true liquiditty that other traders could take advantage of. The block trade just happened to be reported after-hours when AAPL was trading at a different price.

415,"Yes, if you invested every penny you had into CSCO and never sold, you'd not be very happy today. Similarly, if 90% of your portfolio is tied up in TSLA and that collapses, you will be very upset, especially if you plan on retiring in the next five to ten years. But that is exactly why you should always carefully assess your risk tolerance and invest and diversify accordingly. 

That being said, TSLA is where the comparisons to the dot com crash ends. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, ADBE, and other high-growth, high-profit companies like these nowhere near 1999 valuation levels. And while they can be seen as ""expensive"" by traditional valuation metrics like P/E, even brilliant value investors like Joel Greenblatt have conceded that  they are currently selling for a fair price, due to their unbelievable ability to generate free cash flow and ROI (etc). Not to mention their wide moats due to network effects, something Buffett himself, a huge AAPL holder, loves.

416,"Traditionally, as you approach retirement age, you would begin selling your growth stocks (and most of your equities), using that money to invest in safer assets, like bonds, which you'd then draw an income from.

Alternatively, you could invest some of that into high yield stocks like REITs, but any dividend paying stock runs the risk of that dividend being cut during a financial crisis, like COVID or the 2008 financial collapse. And if you suddenly need a lot of money and the market is down, you may end up having to sell your stocks at a loss, whereas bonds help protect against that, since they usually work as a market hedge. 

Alternatively, you could hold your growth stocks in perpetuity and draw income by selling some of your profits, but again, if the market tanks for a few years right as you turn 70, you may end up eating into the principle. So it's all about assessing your risk tolerance, your age and expected income needs. 

For instance, assume I'll one day sell most of my equities and be in bonds and REITS. But I have 25 years ahead of me until retirement, so buying and holding potential high-growth equities like AAPL, MSFT, SPOT, etc, makes sense for me. For now. But if I get really lucky, maybe I can cash out a few in 10 years and start drawing income sooner.

That said, the companies with really high P/E ratios these days (or non-existent P/Es because their earnings are negative) seem to be the companies you just described: unprofitable and debt laden. It's this prolonged period of low interest rates that has allowed many of these companies to take on a lot of debt and loans in hopes of expanding and becoming profitable by the time they need to refinance or start paying those debts. However, because many of these companies are in tech they are seen as attractive businesses to some investors which is why there are so many skeptics for some of these companies with outrageous valuations with a supposedly promising future (example someone gave above was Uber - good product that people use but in terms of investing they don't turn a profit).",2021-03-23 04:04:00,2021-03-23,0.1756

Why? Apple has an incomprehensible amount of free cash. Their capability ceiling is enormous, they can enter and dominate large markets as they choose. They also do this very carefully, their acquisition strategy is aggressive but economic. 

Looking to the EV Future, Apple is one of the leading battery companies and this gets overlooked. They have an ability to turn their suppliers into dominant players just through commitment.

Finally, their brand is alive. Apple has passed the point of being just a company, they‚Äôre a living breathing force that has withstood the test of time. Their flexibility and agility in their supply chain is also world class

Apple is down $20 from its all time high and the market has dictated this, not anything from the company. Look at it this way, the market has allowed discounted entry based on external factors which are basically unrelated to the firms competitiveness.

464,"This is going right over your head isn't it? I said to justify the CURRENT P/E then either the price would have to go down or the earnings would have to go up a ton. I never said that earnings and price BOTH couldn't go up 10 years from now. However, in that scenario 10 years from now it's still logical where something has to give. There would still have to be extreme earnings growth unless you are still willing to pay a premium P/E in the triple and quadruple digits 10 years from now.

I'll spell this out using rounded numbers. If the stock price is $700 and has a P/E of 1000 today. In 10 years it's highly unlikely a company with a current market cap of 700B will still have that high of a P/E because people will expect results over 10 years. So the more likely scenario is a P/E around 50-75 (GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL are 25-35, AMZN is around 70). In order to have a P/E in the double digits then earnings will have to go up 1000/50 = 20x. The stock price would be unchanged in that scenario. So in order to have the stock price go up and get its investors real growth, then the earnings will have to also go up that much more. So if you want 20% gains since it's a growth company then earnings would in theory need to go up 20x + an additional 20%/year. This scenario DOES NOT have to be true. The price could go up a lot, and keep the P/E very high, but that's a very risky assumption that TSLA won't act like 99% of the rest of the market for an additional 10 years.

What already happened the last 2-3 years already happened. No one, including me, is saying TSLA will fail. But past gains don't imply future gains.

I will never return to the gym given the time saved and convenience of working out at home.

Also a lot of people don‚Äôt realize how fast spin classes get booked up at regular gyms. I‚Äôm sure people don‚Äôt want to deal with trying to register for a spin class.

How do I decide? I like the products of the company which I buy shares from. If I like their products, that means there are many others who love their products. If there are lots of people like their products, you can't go wrong with your choice.

I wouldn't own any AAPL if  I wasn't using an Iphone. 

Same with PEP. Their cola is just superior. (I do drink Coca cola too but PEP has always something special) 

I use AMD CPU's in all of my computers both desktop and laptop. Looks like I like AMD's products too. (Would like to have some Nvidia shares but they are pricey. They are also great if you can afford the price tag.)

I have many credit cards and all of them are MasterCard but for some reason I bought VISA shares. :)

3M. They make almost everything. Always my first choice. Instant buy.

TLDR; Take a look at which products you use in your daily life the most and buy their shares. If their products somehow reached you and their product is always your first choice (or sometimes second choice), that means they are successful at what they do.

198,"Hi,

I see you are a fan of biotech. Thermo Fisher, agilent, danaher. All excellent companies, though I do worry that their stock prices are somewhat expensive. Agilent for example, has had it's revenues and gross profits increase by 20% over 5 years, with EPS wildly fluctuating between the years. A P/E of 50 is difficult to justify under the current earnings. Though the EPS has grown 50% in the last year, Eps is well below 2019 for example. 2020 was a weird year. Anyway. If you have strong reasons to believe in 50% earnings growth, year over year for the next 3 years or so, I would say the price is justified. Otherwise, though the stock price may continue to rise for 6 mo, a year, or two years, eventually it will come in line with earnings. I will reiterate that agilent is an excellent company on both balance sheet and on product development. However, I worry that their stock price is too expensive, and wager it will fall in the next 3 years unless tremendous growth is just around the corner.

For example, AMD projects 50% yoy growth in 2021. It did that last year. It has the market opportunity to do that for several years to eat into intel's market share. The market in general is rapidly expanding. At a pe of 35, AMD is a bargain. 

Many companies on your list also suffer from expensive stock values relative to earnings, and recommend caution. Excellent companies, but I worry about their growth prospects. If you believe in their growth prospects will match their p/e, then great. AAPL and MSFT are safe bets. Fintech kind of scares me but will probably grow.

One technical indicator I learned about too late is moving averages crossing. If the 5 day moving average crosses the 30 day moving average going up, it's a buy signal. If the 5 day crosses the 30 day going down, it's a sell signal. It gives you false buy and sell signals periodically, and you'll never catch the high or low, but it does catch the main trend.

I'm an old investor... and I learned about this signal after I lost 2 years pay in the 1987 stock market crash. If I had known it and followed it, I would have avoided losing a lot of money along the way.

235,I don't think anything is wrong with holding tobacco companies but you mentioned diversification.  What happens if WTO or EU or US switches mindset towards banning tobacco products.  Biden could also see another sin tax as a way to bring in more revenue and a tobacco tax could reduce consumptions.   All of the companies will be hit the same.  Perhaps you can hold your percentage of diversification across industries.  so for example you hold $1000 of both AAPL and MSFT and you spread $2000 total across all the different tobacco companies instead of $1000 into each.,2021-05-07 11:32:29,2021-05-07,-0.7876

I've been in IT for a couple decades now, and believe it or not AAPL has been largely absent from most enterprise applications for most of it.  That's changing fast... AAPL products are now ubiquitous in almost every technology decision.  Covid &amp; the work-from-wherever has further amplified that.  

But it's more than fair to consider how those past stock dynamics could be of influence.  I'd go a step further and say it would be negligent not to do that.

Between 2010 and late 2019 they pretty consistently traded on a PE of around 13-18

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/pe-ratio)

It's only since 2019 after the 2018 dip that they started soaring, up to 20+ and then after COVID 30+ Lets assume they meet earnings expectations which even I, an AAPL bear, think is a safe assumption - that means that if the stock price stays exactly flat for months (is that what AAPL investors want?) they'll reach the forward ratio of 25 - that's still like at least 35-40% above where they‚Äôve normally been when the market is not in a bubble about to pop. 

Even if they smash expectations, grow into these news spaces which they're flirting which allegedly 'justify the higher PE' - today's valuation just doesn't hold up in my opinion. And people say ""well monetary police has expanded the range of acceptable earnings ratios"" but I mean the 10Y has been under 3% for a long time and interest rates were 0% for most of that 2010 - 2019 period were they traded at a PE of 15? What changed to make 30 acceptable, besides of course, a tsunami of retail investors that have piled more money into shares in the last 12 months than the many previous years combined on hype around promises and vision of ‚Äútech being the future‚Äù? 

And what happens when monetary police reverts ( or will 0% interest rates remain forever?) and interest rates start going up - now there is theoretically a contractionary force acting on the share price where even if earnings go up the share price will go down. If It's a seriously a ""long term holding"" for people buying today's price (and not a speculative gamble made by amateur investors who are buying the biggest company in the world at near its ATH because ""i like apple and their financial reports have numbers which are very big on them"") .. I just can't fathom it.

255,"One bad luck black swan event and you're entire portfolio will go to zero. A 20% drawdown will be become a 40% draw down due to margin call.

Imagine you went into FAANG on margin last week when AMZN, GOOG, AAPL and MSFT blew out earnings. They all pumped, and you said: fuck it, lets do it.

Since then, depending on your stock profile, you could have eaten 15% losses in the market. AMZN is down 10% from its peak, and so is AAPL and MSFT. Imagine getting margin called and those 15% losses now turning into 30% because you were on margin. Could you stomach that loss?

This is a risky idea because the over leverage will create an uneven risk/reward ratio for the potential upside. So if FAANG grows at 10% this year, and your margin interest rate is 9%, and VOO grows at 10%, then what? You're taking on huge 50% loss risks for 9% additional gains. That doesn't feel like its worth it IMHO.

In my opinion, margin is more used for short term swing plays where you have greater confidence in the movement. Not for long term holds unless you can absorb that level of risk.

How quickly can you get $200k again? Because if you can't do it fast, then you're going to dick yourself pretty hard.


I'm open to conversation on this, as I rarely use margin and leverage for long term holds. Others that are more advanced may give you better advice.",2021-05-06 17:39:18,2021-05-06,0.3865
256,"Compare DIS to similar companies. DIS is weird to measure because its a combination of:

- online streaming platform
- resorts and cruises
- merchanidising
- theme parks
- media and production company

I think its really hard to value DIS personally, even though I'm super bullish.

Lets compare each of those sectors to market leaders via mkt cap:

Online Streaming: NFLX $220Bn

Cruises: CCL $30Bn

Theme Parks: SIX $3Bn

Media and Production: VIAC $24Bn

If you add up all those individual companies and made a chimera, you'd have a mkt cap of 277Bn.

DIS is trading at $330Bn mkt cap right now. So do you believe that DIS is worth more than all those companies combined? Its not apples-to-apples, but valuing DIS is just as difficult as valuing SONY or AAPL. When a company has so many different revenue streams, it can get complicated where the valuations go.

Just be aware that DIS bought Marvel in 2009. Back then DIS was trading at $23. After that purchase, DIS rallied to $90 then stayed for 5 years, pushing as high as $144 before the COVID crash.

So the question is, how much of the Marvel + StarWars + Fox catalogue is already baked into the price. And how much is left to grow.

I think we saw lots of reopening stocks rally in November in preparation for Joe Biden presidency and a strong push for vaccinations. We're seeing lots of reopening already priced in.

Also, don't forget that DIS operates many of its revenue streams in pretty shit margins.


Some additional history, DIS did FY2020 annual report on November 12. That week DIS jumped from $120 to $140 and rallied to $180 over the next few weeks.

https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2020/11/q4-fy20-earnings.pdf

Look at page 3 where you can see the revenue breakdown by sector. You can see that their parks/experiences revenue was down 37% yoy and studio entertainment was down 13% yoy. Even if DIS posts a 100% yoy revenue increase in both those sectors in 2021 (which seems currently impossible), the cagr will only be 15% yoy growth compared to 2019.

With that all said, would you say that 15% yoy revenue growth justify a stock price increase in 2020 from $140 to $180 in 2020 (approx 30% increase)?

I think DIS will trade sideways for at least 2 more years until COVID totally clears up. Until then, I would say that online streaming revenues are priced in, along with the upcoming Marvel gen4 releases and all other things.


Like everyone else on this thread, DIS is a winner long term. But the next 3 years it may be not beat VOO. But when it starts firing on all cylinders again and all that pent up demand starts surging into parks and entertainment, expect DIS to rally hard.",2021-05-06 17:28:04,2021-05-06,0.9918

Selling covered calls is another option. But you need 100 shares. You can collect a premium as a way to slowly reduce your cost basis. It's also a way to force you to think long term. It also puts you in the position of feeling good when the stock doesn't go up too much because you pocket the premium and keep the shares.

290,"Dividend investing is a long term strategy to build wealth. Essentially a few key things to it are:

* Companies raise their dividends overtime, so you want to be in a company that consistently grows and raises their dividend each year.

* The longer you hold a stock the more your 'yield on cost' goes up due to said dividend raises. For example there's a lot of long time investors in stocks like MSFT, AAPL, MMM, JNJ, etc. that are getting 10% annual yields on shares they bought many years ago. These high quality companies dividends were never yielding at 10% at any point in their history, but they have been consistently raising their dividend overtime.

* Overtime the more dividends you have coming in the faster you can build your 'dividend snowball'. For example say you can only invest $25,000 a year. If you start bringing in $5,000 a year in just dividends you've increased your investment capital by 20%, which lets you build more dividend income faster.

If you want to see what you can really do overtime with dividend investing I'd suggest checking out the 'GenExDividendInvestor' Youtube channel. The guy recently retired and now lives off of $80,000 in annual dividend income from a $2.2ish million dollar portfolio.",2021-05-05 14:19:08,2021-05-05,0.6946

293,"\[quote\]Buffett yields 50% from his Coca-Cola investment\[/quote\]

This is an incredibly misleading framing; the only people who use ‚Äòyield‚Äô this way are people who are writing bad articles about why dividend investing is great.  You‚Äôre using the word ‚Äòyield‚Äô to describe the dividend payment today relative to the money he invested in 1988, but the actual relevant comparison is what the yield is today compared to *what else he could be doing with the money today* or, if you really want to compare over time, how much he‚Äôs earned since 1988 compared to what he would have earned if he had put all his money in a growth stock that paid no dividend.

Here‚Äôs a chart showing what one would have if you invested 100% in AAPL vs KO in 1985 (stopping in 2012, when AAPL began paying dividends.). TLDR: the non-dividend paying investment was an order of magnitude more successful.

Either that, or set trailing stop losses for all your positions, loose enough so that they're not going to trigger on a bi-weekly correction, but tight enough to preserve most of your profits in case of a larger crash.

Regarding the latter, I realize that stop losses aren't perfect, but I'd rather get out of a $100 stock at $80 after setting a $90 stop than waiting until the crash is in full effect and getting out at $50. Especially if my cost basis was $40, for example.

389,"&gt; when you buy AAPL on a german stock exchange or the NYSE, it¬¥s still the same company. it affects the same value.

Call it separate marketplaces then if you want. 

Some major US companies are listed in non-US continents, just like you get eg European companies listed (or listed via ADRs) in the US. The volumes do tend to be smaller in their non-home marketplace -it's why you see them kinda getting dragged along with the US market once that opens. 

&gt; if I buy shares of companies (or ETF¬¥s ) that are traded globally, I must be able to react and take part in the global market the same way other market participants can.

&gt; only because german markets are closed, I cannot react to news happening in the US.

I don't consider it so much a problem for individual stocks, because you have two options open to you for that: 

1) just buy them on their home marketplace (NYSE /Nasdaq), or 

2) Tradegate is open 8:00-22:00 CEST/UTC+2. This means you can buy and sell your shares/ETFs during US opening times on a European market. 

You absolutely can react if you really want to. Look at it this way: if everyone had 24/7 opening hours you couldn't react to the constantly rolling news either because of minor concerns like sleeping living IRL. It would disadvantage retail investors even more. Tbh US opening times are pretty convenient for Europeans, with how they fall in the afternoon/evening but not too late for a reasonable bed time.

The main reason I called it a bit of a problem for ETFs is that if for example you have your heart set on buying and selling in USD or CHF, Zurich market (a common home to ETF listings in those two currencies) has no extended opening hours. European private investors also can't really buy US ETFs (which could be bought on a US marketplace) we need the locally-domiciled UCITS versions.",2021-05-03 09:55:14,2021-05-03,0.6064

securities are not like commodities where there is actual logistics, transportation and production process needed. its all digital anyways.

when you buy AAPL on a german stock exchange or the NYSE, it¬¥s still the same company. it affects the same value. 

the whole premise needs to change in my personal opinion.

* GOOG: I'm skeptical on their ability to continue growing so rapidly. They're overly dependent on ads, and they dominate some of their markets (like search) so much that it's nearly impossible for them to grow it anymore without the market itself growing. The only thing Google has that I can see fueling above average growth overtime is Waymo's self driving vehicles, and a lot of evidence seems to show that Google themselves is losing confidence in Waymo (i.e. selling equity in Waymo to third parties despite having tens of billions in cash sitting around, top Waymo people leaving of late).

* FB: Too overly dependent on ads, and I don't see their non-ad revenue segments doing all that well. Like Google they also lack growth potential due to already dominating social media so much, not to mention there's *zero* chance the government is going to let them buy up another social media competitor again given all the anti-trust talk there already is around Facebook.

* AAPL: I think the Apple vs Epic lawsuit is a huge risk that could really hurt them in the next 5 to 10 years. Even if Epic loses in court, there's the legal risk of various governments cracking down on their monopoly like powers in their iOS eco-system. But at the same time I can't deny their ability to constantly defy my expectations and continue to grow. Given the mixed circumstances I put them right in the middle, with the highest probability to over or under perform based on stuff I outlined.

* AMZN: Unlike others on this list, while AMZN is huge, they aren't so big they lack any room to keep growing in their biggest markets. They're involved in a ton of different things. I think they'll continue to do well overtime.

* MSFT: The most well oiled machine of the bunch imo. They're well diversified and Azure is a beast. I think they'll continue to grow nicely overtime and outperform the other FAANGM stocks.",2021-05-02 18:53:44,2021-05-02,0.9521

Yes. I actually wrote an article on that.

Wrong.  It's bizarre that you think that the consumer market regards him as the greatest CEO.  The consumer market doesn't even think of him, other than the punchline of ""Tim Apple"".

If you want an article that's about AAPL, you're in luck, because I wrote one two days ago.  And it was very pro-AAPL.

On an objective level, Apple Watch is just a super limited two inch extended screen.  

Despite the odd name, air pods are actually ear phones.  

As for the M1, no, Tim Cook did not invent the CPU.  And for that matter, he didn't invent the M1 either.  It's a modified ARM chip.  That's what was in the first iPhone and that hasn't changed.

What car technology?  But even if the Apple weren't imaginary, Tim Cook didn't invent the car either.  This is however now the third decade in which it's been rumored that Apple will stick their logo on someone's car.  Not an invention. 

Having a higher number of unenthused customers proves he's been uninspiring, not inspiring. And ""brand loyalty"" is a meaningless statistic in terms of customer delight.  It just means people bought the same old thing as last time.  It doesn't mean they like you.  

If you would have been around Apple in the 1990 to 2015 era, you'd know what I'm saying.  People were *in love* with Apple and Apple products.  It was a movement, a way of life.  Now they buy them, but aren't really happy about it.

‚Ä¢	‚Å†sell my overlapping stock positions in my RobinHood portfolio and use the equity gained to invest in growth stocks that aren‚Äôt in my 401k funds.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†up my 401k contribution since I‚Äôm only doing 4% which my employer then matches with a specific percentage

I just feel like it‚Äôs somewhat dumb to invest in overlapping companies in two accounts. I might as well buy them only in the 401k since I‚Äôm not even taxed there whereas my salary gets taxed before I can load funds into RobinHood. What do you guys think?",2021-05-02 09:10:14,2021-05-02,0.9168

I think this can be attributed to more people taking up the stock market as a hobby, and more people buying more shares will increase the price.

The unfortunate truth is that many of these new investors will likely sell at the first sign of a crash, so if and when we see another correction of sectors such tech, I think that‚Äôs when the true downfall will come.

418,"I'd like to see a disciplined proof of Tim Cook as ""best CEO in the world"".  

First of all, drawing Secretariat as your horse doesn't mean you're the world's best jockey.  

Second, his function has largely been that of milking the most possible money out of cell phones.  Apple hasn't invented anything since before Steve Jobs died... since Jobs was healthy, actually.

Apple's consumer halo has tarnished a fair bit under his leadership.  The products are now more grudgingly accepted than beloved.  Product announcements aren't aspirational events anymore, they're exercises in financial analyst skulduggery.  And launches don't generate buoyant camp-outs, they just trigger griping about what feature was scrapped and which new defect will drive which new recall and/or rationalization campaign.  I'd argue that any other bean counter could do that.  

Under Cook, Apple has gone from a prestige employer to just another corporation.  What and who has he inspired?  Where is the culture-defining advertising?  Where's his Chiat-Day? Where's his Jony Ives?  Where's his Pixar?  What market has he disrupted?  How is Beats doing?  How is Apple TV?

His main inventions:  

* not including needed sockets
* not including earphones
* not including a charger

Apple is still practicing corrupt accelerated obsolescence, stealing digital content after you bought it, environmental damage, monopolistic behavior, and exploiting sweatshop labor.  They're still the Tony Soprano of crooked opposition to right-to-repair.  He's made no progress towards being a made in America company.  

How is that ""best CEO in the world""?  He took an *interesting* and massively profitable cell phone company and transformed it into a *boring* and massively profitable cell phone company.  Anyone could have done that.  

If I'm looking for positives, I guess I could say that once it was 110% personally safe for him to do so, he came out.  And he has been holding the line on topics related to privacy, I guess.  

But I just don't see what amazing accomplishment or inspiration he's demonstrated.  

Edit: for the fanboys that have started polluting my inbox, this isn't an anti-AAPL post.  It's a counterpoint about Tim Cook as CEO.

Advice 1: Don‚Äôt aim to become a millionaire overnight. Slow and steady will win you the race. Meaning that, don‚Äôt get sucked into trading meme stocks like GME. If you must buy stocks, start with big names like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT etc. Can‚Äôt go wrong with the big tech. However, if you are not a fan of buying into individual stocks, consider ETFs that are a blend of several stocks. Like SPY, QQQ, VTI etc. 

Advice 2: Diversify. Don‚Äôt simply buy 100% tech or 100% finance or 100% SPACs. At least for the first few years, try not to exceed more than 20% in any one sector. Do tech, finance, healthcare, REITs, energy etc. Not sure which stocks would fall into those sectors? Just look at the composition of their corresponding ETFs. Example: look at which stocks make up XLE.

Advice 3: Don‚Äôt panic sell even if market goes down. Stay the course and stay invested come rain or shine. Market recovers from crashes pretty quickly. If you pull out, you will lose out on the recovery and could end up losing a lot of money in the process.

By the time you're in your 20s, AAPL will have given you a good return, I'd bet. They're also increasing their dividend at a high rate so if you have a broker that offers DRIP,opt into that to grow it more.

If you do want to diversify, look for other giants equal to apple in other sectors. AAPL is technology, so other immovable blue chips would be KMB for consumer cyclicals, VZ in telecom, LMT in defense, CAT in industrials, O in real estate, AFL in financials, and ABBV in healthcare.

3) stuff your money into QYLD/RYLD and collect/reinvest the dividend. This gives you the most free cash, but the funds will barely grow in value.",2021-05-01 16:29:39,2021-05-01,0.8317
426,"I've taken up dividend investing in the past few months, here's what I know so far:

1) if you hold a share before the ex-dividend date, you are eligible to get a dividend payout from that stock

2) dividends come from the company's profits- they are removed from the stock price, but not covered as a loss. So in your example (simplifying down to owning 1 share) of you have a share that is $27, that pays out 68 cents a share, you end up with a share that costs $26.32, and 68 cents off free spending money, and your brokerage shouldn't be showing that position in the red.

3) there are 5 types of dividend payout; weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. They pay out 52, 12, 4, 2, and 1 time per year, respectively.
These can happen at any date/day.

4) the strategy you described to but, qualify, then sell is a used tactic, but it's not really sustainable. There's several videos on it and it's problems. Because a lower price leads to more shares being scooped up, the share price tends to bounce back after dividend payment, so it's usually a better strategy just to hold onto your investment until you hear news that gives you an indication to sell.

5) look for companies in the dividend aristocrats/ kings list; companies like T, VZ, MO, KMB, XOM, O, MAIN, AFL, and CVX have 4-7% dividend yields, while also increasing their dividend payout so the longer you hold a position the more it makes for you.

Side advice: Don't chase yield, chase companies with stability that have a history of increasing dividends at a high rate. I'd rather have $1000 in AAPL than $1000 in a company with a 14% yield that'll crash in a month. The only accepting to that are a few ETFs out there that do covered calls, they're very stable and barely change in value, but pay out roughly 10-12%, they're not growth companies but they do pay monthly and can be good compounders; QYLD and RYLD are the 2 I'm invested in.

Of course, make sure to do your own research and only buy into companies you like.

431,"Yeah definitely much more exposure to a downside move if it stays suppressed through the duration of the contract, or worse, takes a nose dive 6 months to exp when it doesn't have time to recover. Thats why even though I've been buying leaps at ATH's recently and a pullback could easily be in the pages, my time horizon is still 2 years. Its also best to roll the leaps at 1 year - 6 months in my opinion, lest you try to get more gains only to have a black swan event kill the contract before it can recover. I should also mention that just owning the stock actually has more negative skew (you'd be out twice or thrice as much money for less delta to the upside to own 100 shares vs 2 contracts at .5 delta) but because stock gives you an infinite timeline to recover you aren't out the full investment if it trades down consistently but eventually recovers. Even if you had bought a LEAPS in February on most names you'd be substantially ahead of having just bought shares at the same point despite the massive covid selloff. Particularly where I buy my calls I am very vulnerable in the short term though because I typically only buy at .60 - .75 delta whereas others go for .75 - .9 which is simply excessive on a name like AAPL in my opinion. But if AAPL falls to 110 and my calls are now far OTM and I place PMCCs against that and AAPL then shoots through my sold calls, I'd be out money so that means I'm taking a bigger risk selling against my OTM calls as opposed to deep ITM ones. The PMCC revenue typically means worst case you break even over the lifetime of a long dated leaps, but I just make sure not to use so many PMCCs that I couldn't exercise the contracts if they were above water by exp, so in my portfolio right now its a bet that companies like AAPL, MSFT, DIS and etfs like IWM and SPY will be above their current levels by Jan 2023 essentially and if worse comes to worst, I'll see the contract through to intrinsic value only and exercise with the cash I haven't deployed.

437,"&gt;I don't like the idea of a defensive portfolio having heavy weightings &gt;= 5% on 5 individual stocks. That adds a lot of beta for what kind of return? A hope that these individual stocks will outperform the market?

APPL and MSFT may outperform, will likely match, may underperform but slightly.  I find it unlikely that they will tank, and near impossible that they will tank (independently from the market) before I'm able to get out in time.

Tobacco stocks are simply for the dividend.  In terms of appreciation they will likely underperform or could even result in losses, which is something I need to be vigilant about.  The dividend, however, outperforms pretty much any other fixed income at the moment.  These companies are sound and not going anywhere anytime soon, except perhaps Imperial Brands, which I will need to keep an eye on.

&gt;The going wisdom right now is to be overweight on international as a defensive stance. Intl stocks have far better ratios on P/E, forward P/E and P/B. VXUS is great. A small dash of frontier could be good as well.

Do you have a source for that?  I mean, I understand the part about P/E ratios, etc. But I also understand that the Fed is pumping up asset prices, and IMO, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  In a way riding the wave *is* a defensive play.  I would absolutely not go 100% on it though, that's loco.

&gt;If I were running a high concentration of individual stocks in a defensive portfolio, I can't imagine stocks like AAPL and MSFT being the top picks (of megacap growth, they have some of the worst P/E and P/Bs, even though they are very fairly priced IMO. But GOOG and FB are both far superior picks). I would rather take below NAV SPACs for the high optionality and asymmetric upside if I were very insistent on capital preservation. If capital preservation isn't the primary goal, then why not just 100% index funds or a mix of index + individual growth stocks (your AAPLs, MSFTs etc) and ride out volatility for long term returns?

I bought MSFT and AAPL because I understand the companies and their products.   GOOG and FB are kind of mysteries to me, and frankly, GOOG is out of my price range and my brokerage doesn't offer fractional shares.

I wouldn't say capital preservation is my primary goal.  But it's one goal.  I think between total risk-on and total defensiveness there is a middle ground.  I tried to capture something of the best of both worlds here, although I imagine I'm leaning more towards risk-on with this allocation.  Still, less risk-on than 100% equities.

Honestly, I see a lot of uncertainty in the future.  Coming out of Covid, global warming, geopolitics.  I'm not hoarding guns or ammo, but I think we're facing challenges that investors from 1950 - 2000 just didn't face.  I like Ray Dalio's idea of ""you never know what's gonna happen, so be prepared"".  I'm scared of 100% equities, but hey, I like making money.",2021-05-01 00:34:32,2021-05-01,0.9923

476,"I only recently talked with a friend about exactly this topic.

consider this: avg margin of profit for large companies (not outliers like AAPL , MSFT etc) would be like 2-5% / year. and thats being generous. there¬¥s business that are happy to beat 3% regularily.

now lets compare a super boring portfolio:

all money into one ETF:like $VOO: 10-15% / Year.

&amp;#x200B;

that might not be the smartes way to allocate for risk,, but I think it covers the basic idea.

conclusion:

why on earth would I invest all my capital into a company that is much more complex, harder to manage, has social responsibilities to employees, legal stuff..

when I could also invest it all into the market, get much higher returns and basically have only taxes to worry about ?

so from a returns / mnagement perspective, the portfolio wins, hands down. I don¬¥t think the comparison is fair though.

socially and in regards to ethics, I would think owning and running a business has far more value than just owning shares.

you provide jobs, offer measurable services / products to society. you bring value.so even though it is much more hassle and stress, I think running a business is actually worthwhile.

Edit: I will however say that if you do decide to take the risk and put all your eggs in one basket, AAPL is a good choice",2021-04-30 07:42:17,2021-04-30,0.5859

483,"Haha yeah sorry, when you're just starting out it can be a lot. To clarify, you always get the premium when you sell a contract upfront in full, it's yours. So if I sell a covered call on AAPL at the 140 strike expiring in two weeks for 50 dollars, that 50 is now in my account. Its mine. If AAPL finishes above 140, my shares will be called away, I will get 14k(100 * 140) PLUS the 50 that I get to keep. You could buy to close early though and thats highly recommended as expiration approaches if you wanted to in which case your profit would be 50 - cost to close. But you always get to keep the premium if the option expires either in the money (itm) aka 140 or out of the money (otm) aka 139 in my AAPL example. I generally scalp about 25-50 bucks per 1 lot (100 shares) on AAPL a week selling .30 delta calls. Not bad!

I highly recommend tastytrade videos on trading options, it all comes with practice. This is their video on the PMCC I explained above: https://youtu.be/hZ8FDD8Y_JE. Let me know if you have questions, always happy to help people learn options.",2021-04-30 03:21:52,2021-04-30,0.9763
484,"Yep! I sell covered calls on all my positions, its a great and low risk way to generate modest returns and get a tiny bit of downside protection. Its also where most people get their start with options, then typically dabbling into cash secured puts to run the wheel strategy (sell puts until assigned the shares, then sell calls on that and repeat until the shares are called away and you sell puts again). I typically sell my cc's at .30 delta or lower. I also use long dated itm options (LEAPS) which don't decay as quickly as near dated ones to simulate a buy and hold strategy, then sell calls against that. This is known as ""poor man's covered calls"" and are the most profitable part of my portfolio. Its a synthetic/leveraged buy and hold strategy, I typically reinvest the short call profit into shares of the underlying. So instead of buying 100 AAPL shares, I buy 5 itm 2023 AAPL contracts and sell calls near term against those. That way I control more shares, typically 5 contracts at .7 delta (delta = move in the underlying aka if AAPL moves a dollar in either direction and I have 300 delta, I would make or lose 300 dollars). Perfect strategy to run on low volatility names like AAPL, MSFT, or etfs like SPY, QQQ, IWM, etc and great if you can't afford  a 1 lot (100 shares). I use it as an engine building way to build out my long positions, you can think of it like a DRIP approach on steroids. If you have questions about options and particularly selling options I highly recommend r/thetagang.

490,"Step 2 - do ETFs until you have $10k


Step 3 - only do stocks with money you are comfortable losing and have time to recover from

Step 4 - accept that stocks are like pets, they deserve a certain amount of attention every day that you own them, from research to learning the markets, listening to conf calls, reading reports, etc. 


Step 5 - with step 4 in mind, be diversified.  For most average individuals, that means at least 4 or 5 stocks representing different sectors, while remembering you still need to keep up with each of them.  

Step 6 - don't fall in love with a stock such that it becomes your one and only, or a ""forever"" commitment.  It's a piece of paper, or not even that.  Have a target in mind and be prepared to sell it if it achieves the target.  Be mindful of looking for what the *next* AAPL might be.  

Step 7 - get enough invested so that your money is working for you, not you working for your money. 

Step 8 - optimize the emotional aspect.  If you get to the point of doing it full time, strive to have many positions so that there's always something happening that pertains to one of your current tickers.  It keeps things interesting and keeps you motivated.  I wasted years fixated on my tiny list of positions because I considered them ""best"" while I got disillusioned watching scores of tickers on my watch lists have exciting events and thinking I was also so close to owning them.

And Step 1 is buy or go to the library and get a Jim Cramer book that explains similarly, but in more detail.  He may play a crazy person on social media and, to a lesser extent, on TV.  But his lessons for beginning stock market investors are rock solid.

If all this seems like too much, just do your investing using quality, low cost ETFs, and just use your gambling budget for stock picking.",2021-04-30 00:07:12,2021-04-30,0.9188

493,"I've come to hate Apple, but will they?  

They've sold astronomical loads of hardware over a year in which their factories and stores have all been shut down for significant periods.  

They've sold their crappy services for real money.  

They've been a cell phone company for many years, but now there's credible reason to think they might pump up laptop, tablet and computer sales.  

They somehow pulled off an incredibly rapid and successful termination of Intel.  Intel!  Apple's own designed chip somehow trounces the best of what Intel can make.  Intel's chips need mini air conditioning systems to function, while Apple/ARM replacements can sit in your pocket.  I though it would take years for the performance to catch up, and then they just... did it.  First gen.

They're also one of the only enterprises that's tuned in correctly to the world population's sentiment that nobody likes heavy covert user tracking.  They're the only company that could conceivably take a huge bite out of Facebook's massive domination of social messaging.  If iMessage were branded and run more distinctly, it would be bigger than things like Twitter, Snap, and PINS put together.

6,"Hey all -- just wanted to say thanks for this community. You all helped get me through the pain of holding with a portfolio that got as bad as -15% after buying so many stocks at Feb ATH's. I held through the tech correction of the past 4.5 months and at long last, my portfolio just entered green for the first time since Feb. I know things can quickly turn negative. But I'm in for the long term. My experience, as short as it has been, just shows you how important it is to not just trust your picks and hold through the ups and down, but also how good it was to see others were going through the same thing. Keep strong everyone!

Some examples:

I saw my 1,200 shares of AAPL go from my 127 buy price in August to 106, up to 144, down to 119, back up to 140, down to 124, and up and down several times, and is now back to Feb levels at 134.

I saw my PYPL shares go from my buy price of 253 to 310, down to 222 and now back up to 290.

I saw my CSTL shares go from 74 to 50 and now back to 75 (its ATH is 106).

I saw TSLA go from 860 to 400, back now to 683 (still a long way to go on this one lol).

I saw AMD go from 88 to 74 to 88 to 74 and now at 86 (almost there).

I bought into some new positions at the lows of the past few months (when I was fearful and pretty beat up with my other stocks), and those are doing well for me.

All in all, I am now at a point where I can hold my jewels and start looking at getting out of some I don't care for.

ALSO gained some valuable lessons, biggest of which is: DON'T FOMO. I fomo'd into stocks I was watching right at the top because they were suddenly on a rip and I was worried I wouldn't get in. Caused me to disregard the price I wanted to enter at. Pretty much all of these stocks dipped either later that day or a few days later to my buy price. Lesson: stick to your plan, don't focus on the literal second-to-second trading.

Another lesson: be leery of buying and selling in pre market. It can be misleading in both directions from the open market. I still struggle with this but more often then not I'll be glad I held off.

Another lesson: there usually is a morning dip at open or a little bit after; or sometimes an afternoon dip. If you're eying a stock, you might be able to catch a better deal on one of those dips.

Final lesson: I'm still working on this. I'm a long-term investor but the Feb ATH still messes with me. Figure out your entry and exit plans for a stock. When PYPL hit 310 I wish I sold because it dropped way down to 228. I'm now going to see what I do if it gets to that point again.

I've been buying into it heavily for months, at a minimum I've been buying 2 shares every pay check. But I rarely see others calling MSFT a buy at reddit or in investing channels. I've seen some people argue that they just won't keep growing, and a lot of others saying it's just too expensive. It doesn't normally get that much love (or even a lot of mentions at all) in investing youtube channels either.

AMZN is almost always called a buy whenever anyone talks about it, I practically never see anyone argue not to buy it, and I've never seen anyone use any kind of analysis/numbers to justify it being overpriced.

AAPL has some people who say it's stupidly overpriced, and some who say it's a crazy steal right now if you look at the forward PE ratio. It's just a more polarizing stock that has a lot haters and a lot of loyal fans.

GOOG &amp; FB have their haters, but also have a lot of people who have been saying for a while that they're really undervalued. I've seen so many youtube videos over the last year or two calling both of them great buys.

When you say gain potential do you mean capital appreciation or income potential?

I just put cash in both accounts and when I saw an opportunity I bought with whatever account had enough cash (big brain moves I know lol). I‚Äôve been trying to change the composition of each account based on the tax differences but I wanted to find out about the pros and cons of my strategy.

My aim is to have the most stable dividend paying companies in my Roth because they‚Äôre tax advantaged, with also a few high yielders there too. This typically involves going with Vanguard index funds like VNQ and VYM, and a few monthly dividend payers like O and JEPI.

Thing is, I bought AAPL in the Roth account and it‚Äôs appreciated. Not sure if I should sell out of this position and build AAPL as a holding in my traditional account. I (like everyone) am bullish on AAPL, so keeping it in the traditional IRA makes it easier to access the potential capital appreciation. AAPL‚Äôs yield is also pretty low so the untaxed divs are not as high as they could be with another holding in the Roth.

What do people think makes more sense to do? Keep AAPL in the Roth and just buy more in the traditional? Sell it and rebuild the holding since I‚Äôm bullish anyway?",2021-06-22 02:55:12,2021-06-22,0.9864
73,"I mean, when I was 22 (2002) I bought 100 shares of AAPL for $14/shares (this might have been 2003, but it was either 2002 or 2003).  I sold about a year later when I'd basically doubled my money. If I'd held those without selling anything, today I would have 5,600 shares worth about $739,000 at today's closing price.

So, the easy answer is that I would tell my 22 year old self, spend the $50,000 on AAPL, get 3,571 shares with that money circa 2002 and don't sell. Then my current 41 year old self would have 199,975 shares just from the splits (I.e. not including any reinvested dividends) worth approximately $26.4 Million at today's closing price. And I could retire.

So, that is an easy answer for me.

If we're not playing the ""back to the future"" game, I would tell myself to ""be boring"" and invest that $50,000 in some low cost funds/ETFs at about 70% VTI/30% VXUS (or equivalent), set them to reinvest dividends and pretend like you don't know that money even exists.

When I'm looking for a company I am looking at current valuation but I'm asking myself if their earnings will beat the market avg over the next 5 years.  Stocks will fluctuate short term based on sentiment, but long term stock prices follow earnings.  Look at AMD - when they've had positive news they've climbed to 85, and other times they fall to 73.  That's a decent change on not much actual news about the company.  I could try to time it, but most people who try that lose money, so I buy and hold.  Add to my position when it drops because long term I see them being worth much more than they are now.  

Because of this outlook, I dont tend to take a lot of risks with my investments.  I'm over 50% sp500 + total market fund.  I'm then 20% into some big individual stocks that weigh heavily in those trackers (aapl, msft, Amazon and adobe).  I've got a couple video game stocks and a couple semi stocks as after researching them I think they have a chance to outperform the market longer term.  

My one real flier of a stock is mastercraft, a small boat maker.  I spent about 4 hours reading up on them and the current boat market before investing anything in them, and feel pretty comfortable with where I'm at cost avg wise.  If I thought one of these got really overextended then I'd sell, or if I lost confidence in the company I would sell.  Other than those, I'm comfortable with letting the companies grow their earnings over the course of years.

If you're trading a 6 month time frame, you're really just trading short term sentiment and that's more akin to gambling than investing.  Nothing wrong with that, but it's a much different DD than I do on my stocks.  The one thing I'd say is try to recognize when hype is already priced in.  Yes alcohol sales could jump this summer, but the real question is are those expectations already reflected in the proce of bud and tap?

It's like a ""let's get married at 40 if we both don't find anyone we like better"" clause, a worst case floor that you hope doesn't come to pass but limits the worst that can happen to you. So to complete the example, the most common scenario for people using puts that way, is that they had bought 100 shares of AAPL at $150, but are worried about some unforeseen black swan like global pandemic no one saw coming, so they buy puts at $120, because they feel the $30 loss per share, they could live with. If AAPL tanked to $90 and stayed there, then the put insurance they'd bought sure is useful!

If you exercise the put, it means you are allowed to ""put"" your share into the put sellers account at the strike price agreed. So if you bought AAPL puts with 120 strike and the stock falls to $110, you have the right to buy at 110 and immediately exercise by putting them to someone else at $120. It's only useful to exercise when your option, in this case a put, is in the money. But if you are before expiry date, usually selling the option itself is the best option, i.e., it will give you more profit. So you did the correct thing in this case.

They (using AAPL in this case - but you can use any tech stock you‚Äôd like) are constantly making products that are universally loved and consumed at crazy high rates.

Over the last twenty years: iPod. iPhone. iPod Touch. MacBook Pro. iPad. More iterations of iPhones that has users buying a new one every two years. Apple Watch. Bought BEATS by Dre and blew that up. Apple Pay. MacBook Air. AirPods.

My recent purchases are IBM, STOR, &amp; FLXN. I get a 1% dividend out of my portfolio.

230,"I'm no expert, but a quick read through the OP's post sounded... suspect.  At random, I decided to use Apple Inc as my reference to see if any of the OP's claims hold water.  Many of these claims seem to be based on reporting by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. Apple claims (and disputes) many inaccuracies in these reports.  Here are some of their rebuttals and clarifications (from an article written in 2017), point for point:

1)  Apple does not and has not ""manipulated its tax residency"" to Ireland.  They actually opened a facility in that country way back in 1980, when Steve Jobs wanted to begin expanding their business overseas.  When first opened, that facility employed 60 people; there are now more than 6,000 workers there.

2)  When Ireland changed its tax laws in 2015, Apple complied by changing the residency of their Irish subsidiaries, and they informed Ireland, the European Commission and the United States. The changes made did not reduce their tax payments in \*any\* country. In fact, their payments to Ireland increased significantly; from 2014 through 2017, Apple Inc has paid $1.5 billion in tax there ‚Äî 7 percent of all corporate income taxes paid in that country during that time.

3)  When a customer buys an Apple product outside the United States, the profit is first taxed in the country where the sale takes place. Then Apple pays taxes to Ireland, where Apple sales and distribution activity is executed by some of the 6,000 employees working there. Additional tax is then also due in the US when the earnings are repatriated. Apple‚Äôs worldwide effective tax rate is 24.6 percent, higher than average for US multinationals. 

Since every country involved is getting a piece of the pie, I don't see how they can all be crying about ""reduced tax take"" from these transactions.

4) Currrent taxes are not assessed based on where the company resides, but rather where the value is created. Under the current international tax system, profits are taxed based on where the value is created. The taxes Apple pays to countries around the world are based on that principle. The vast majority of the value in their products is indisputably created in the United States ‚Äî where they do their design, development, engineering work and much more ‚Äî so the majority of their taxes are owed to the US.

5) From their own web site: ""We understand that some would like to change the tax system so multinationals‚Äô taxes are spread differently across the countries where they operate, and we know that reasonable people can have different views about how this should work in the future. At Apple we follow the laws, and if the system changes we will comply. We strongly support efforts from the global community toward comprehensive international tax reform and a far simpler system, and we will continue to advocate for that.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

The vast majority of my comments above were taken from Apple's article on this very topic.  You can read Apple's compete article here:  [https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/11/the-facts-about-apple-tax-payments/](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2017/11/the-facts-about-apple-tax-payments/)

Full disclosure: I have no position in AAPL (or any other company mentioned by the OP). I just thought some of the OP's claims sounded one-sided, so I went digging for the other side of the argument. I feel it is always wise to hear both sides of any debate, especially before changing laws and/or enacting new ones.",2021-06-16 01:24:43,2021-06-16,0.9923

293,"You're not thinking about it correctly.

When I was buying AAPL a few years ago, their dividend yield was higher than it is now despite the fact that they've raised their dividend every year since I originally bought it. So my dividend yield is lower but my cost basis dividend yield is higher.

It's not that MSFT doesn't pay a lot of dividends, it's that their dividends/future dividends are so highly coveted that it makes the yield look low. 

Here's an example: Buffett bought KO between 1988-1994 for a total cost of $1.3B. Since then Buffett has made $8.5B in total dividends. They will pay out $672M in dividends to Berkshire this year on an investment of $1.3B. KO only has a 3% dividend yield, but that is irrelevant because the cash on cash return doesn't care about current unrealized gains. 

So let's say you bought MSFT exactly ten years ago at $23.71, then your cost basis dividend yield would be 9.2%. 

Most importantly, you wouldn't have to sell shares to receive that payment. That's the problem with appreciation, you have to sell a productive asset (shares) in order to receive an unproductive asset (cash), and even worse, the cash value for your shares is net taxes.

Banning investment in Chinese companies != banning trade with China.  So, yes, U.S. capitalism could absolutely survive banning investment in Chinese companies.  Banning trade is a non-starter.

The battle isn't who can create the next efficient streaming service, its who can create the next hit show/content to retain users. That's a risky business model, imo.  But if you're a huge fan of Disney and consistently buy their merchandise yearly (maybe you have younger siblings/kids), I can see why you would invest in it. Maybe DISNEY will be better in the future now with theme parks and cruises slowly opening up.  


Companies like AMAZON, MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL have various different products/sources of revenue. Hence they are safer bets to take on. As far as entry point, I honestly don't know. A general rule of thumb is to look at Zacks rankings (see if it's a buy signal), and see how the price changed for the current week. If it popped unexpectedly, wait a day or so to see if the price comes down or stabilizes. If it dipped unexpectedly, wait a day or so to see if the price stabilizes.

- These new features are inferior to Facebook's ""WhatsApp"" product which has had these features for half a decade or longer. WhatsApp web can do more today than Apple's web product will be able to do tomorrow and next year and probably the year after that. 

- Facebook is built on data and connections, Apple is built on hardware and isolation. 

Apple will never challenge Facebook for the same reason why Apple will never compete with Google in Search.

People use Facebook for the connections. To be connected to something larger than their Contact Book. The average Facebook user does not want a Social Network inside of their Instant Message app. They want to follow Meme pages and share it around and see globalized personalized content. 

It's not in Apple's DNA to compete in this space. Apple would have to give up on Privacy to compete with Facebook. The Facebook product is inherently unprivate. Little gimmicks like pinning notes in an instant message app change literally nothing.

If they want to invent the next ""Google Circles"" or whatever the next failed social network is, good luck, but Apple's special sauce is far from this arena.

AWK, GWRS and WTRG are involved in water and gas infrastructures so if you'd like to use water in your house in the future, you might want to look into those... I would also throw in AAPL simply because of their current size and variety of possibly very lucrative future streams of revenue they're developing at all times (e.g., making microchips in-house).

391,"So there is this silly thing people believe, it's something like ‚Äúinfinite economic growth is impossible.‚Äù I hear it a lot on Reddit 

There is no reason to believe that economic growth has a cap on it. Humanity is far more efficient, productive and intelligent than it ever has been. 

Just think about farming alone. 300 years ago you're looking about 90% of the population were farmers, in 1900 it was about 40%, now it's about 1.3% of the American population and America is a net exporter of food. Someone working minimum wage can afford to feed themselves for a day with about 1-2 hours of work. That boost to human productivity is massive. So even though you might be mopping floors in Mcdonalds, you're still massively more productive than you would have been 100 years ago when putting food on the table took the majority of your working time. 

This progress of productivity is felt everywhere. Including with companies and their margins. They can produce more for less and you can consume more for less. The more consumption and gdp the more room for total gross profit.

Think about how insane it is that the internet age is only about 25 years old and the massive leap in productivity and utility that has added. Maybe the markets are still catching up to that leap forward. Now think about 1900, when cars weren't even mainstream. 

Of course the market has gone up for 100 years. And of course it's up as the widespread adoption of the computer has taken hold. 

These companies aren't fake (at least most of them aren't). Aapl really did produce $100B operation cash flow last year. Amzn really did have $420B in revenue. They did that by offering goods/services where one party agreed that their money was worth less utility than the product/service they were selling.

398,"You're getting a lot of answers from people who were never in your shoes and only see rent as net cash flow, net of work, net of worries and net of risk. That isn't accurate. You have to maintain your property, you have to carry a liability insurance in case your tenant sues you. You pay property taxes... Like someone in the comments mentioned, it is work. You may also face a tenant who stops paying and won't leave. Not only do you no longer collect rent, you also have to pay attorney fees to evict. Don't expect to retrieve your property in good shape when the sheriff kicks the tenant out. Been there, no fun.

Also, the argument that you shouldn't sell to avoid paying taxes seems like a weak one too. You won't pay taxes on the same gain twice if you switch to stocks, and you're not going to escape taxes by holding on to those properties. Your goal is to build wealth to improve your lifestyle or build a retirement fund. So you will have to sell eventually because you can't pay your kids' college tuition or buy yourself a boat when you're 50 with a townhouse in Seattle. Besides, if you need to sell your property, you have to do some repair to make your property look good, contact your realtor, list the unit, wait for a buyer, go through inspections, etc... It may take months until you actually receive the funds. On the other hand, you can buy stocks today, sell tomorrow, withdraw the funds the next day. The idea is liquidity.

Now the argument of value. Let's see where you'd be if instead of buying that property, you would've invested the same amount of money in Apple for instance, and not even look at your investment until now. In January 2015, AAPL was $26. It was $44 in January 2018. Today before open, it's $126, i.e. +484% from 2015 and +286% from 2018. You can use a Vanguard ETF like VGT if you prefer: +353% since January 2015, +225% since January 2018. Compare this with your +35% and your rent, deduct your mortgage, insurance, repair, realtor fees, property taxes, taxes on your rent, the time you spent dealing with issues...

That being said, stocks are a completely different animal. For starters, it's more volatile. Company performance dictates stock price in the long run, but short term price is very unpredictable. So if you think you'll need the money in less than 6-12 months, don't invest in stocks. But if you won't need the money soon, pick a few solid Vanguard ETFs for instance, you can literally buy today, and not look until 2035. You can also generate some income stream for yourself with covered calls. If you pick your stocks well, you'll see that some can be used for that purpose only and generate more money than rent.",2021-06-07 12:50:22,2021-06-07,0.7753

472,"Basically for increasing liquidity.

They act kind of like middle men in option pricing. To do trade without them, you need a person always on the other side of the trade, which is not always possible in options.

For example, if I decide to sell, say a random option, AAPL 17 SEP 117.5, at that exact second, it is possible that no one(normal trader) is interested in buying that one option directly to me. If no one is buying that exactly at that time, there wont be any bid price, hence there wont be a reference price, very illiquid market.

So the job of these market makers is thus to always give you quotes and to act as buyer and sellers of last resort at all the time. So even though there may not be normal trader like me trying to buy from me, the market maker gives me a quote and is ready to buy it to me at the bid price at any moment.

Then say a few seconds later, there comes another trader who now wants to buy that option. Now the market marker gives him an ask quote and transfer my option to him.

The market maker thus makes money between the bid value given to me Vs the ask value recieved from other.

Remember there are hundreds of option prices for AAPL for different strike and expiry, but only one stock price, hence it is always possible that nobody may be interested in that one random option at that exact second, unlike AAPL stock where there is always demand, so MMs become more important in options market.",2021-06-03 21:50:28,2021-06-03,0.8535

26,"I can't say much about your portfolio. I'm familiar with SPCE and SOFI, but can't in good conscience say that I've looked into them (nor your other 2) much.

As far as buying/selling, my view is that if you've done your homework (prior to buying) and you've watched a stock for a bit and you buy it and it goes down... Unless there is some dramatic reason for why it dropped, I wouldn't plan on selling to cut losses. If the company had good financials, steady growth, potential for more, experienced management, and a history, and everything you read and looked into about it was good..... Then consider the dip a discount (unless there is some unforeseen reason that caused it to drop and will continue to decline).
As far as buying at the right time, I'd say that is more on technical analysis (but I could be wrong - I am not very well versed in TA). If it's something you plan on holding for a while (meaning years) , it shouldn't matter too much when you buy.... Perhaps be cautious about buying soon before or after earnings reports. Being patient is usually a good idea... I am personally anxious to buy some AAPL, but I'm waiting for a pullback into the low 140s or even into 130s. That may never come though. Point is, if you have a chance to save money, you might as well do that. If a stock you like is climbing, wait for a bit of red before buying --- though this does come with the risk of it running up on you.
I think the phrase is ""time in the market, not timing the market"" or something like that. If you plan on holding for years, it won't matter if you save a few bucks on the initial purchase.

My only other advice would be to add stability to your account. Not sure how volatile your stocks are... I know SPCE is pretty much a meme stock, so be careful with that. But I would say add some blue chips to get steady growth in your account. It's kind of demoralizing to see days of pure red, so having things that generally go up more often than not (and hopefully pay a few dividends too) would be smart and encouraging.",2021-08-08 04:10:02,2021-08-08,0.9756

The diversification out of tech is where you would potentially benefit with these ETFs.  That's usually in JPM, Berkshire and maybe a smaller stake in a few other financials.  

If AAPL is 50%+ of your portfolio, yeah it makes sense to invest elsewhere but do not believe it is worth it at the cost of selling Apple.  Drop new money/deposits into other stuff.

Also, many companies are not under analyst scrutiny, this comes to especially small and mid-cap companies, so there are some great value to be found in those, whereas it is unlikely you'll stumble on anything when it comes to something like AAPL that any of the hundreds of Wall Street analysts haven't considered yet.",2021-08-06 10:28:30,2021-08-06,0.7544

55,"True, IBM is an interesting case. Where did it go wrong? I think that's an interesting question to consider. IMO Apple is doing great right now in sheer dollar terms and growth there, but is showing some cracks behind the facade. Services like Apple TV aren't doing great, car=making isn't a great business really (if it happens), and hardware penetration is getting saturated. Of course, sales of airpods can make up for it! Either way, enough people are locked into the ecosystem for now. Watches and airpods are nice, and maybe can sustain Apple long enough to get to the Next Best Thing. I'd bet on it still. Buffett is, it wuld appear. Their ARM chips are the best in consumer devices, though, and that's underappreciated.

I like GOOGL least actually lol. It's an ad company at this point. Lots of investments in AI and other things that are going on behind the scenes that can one day become monetizable. Unclear if GOOGL knows how to do that, though

The key to staying alive may be to ""disrupt"" your business often enough and not grow stagnant. It's really hard to do in the long run, you're right. Still, AMZN, AAPL, MSFT aren't new businesses; they've reinvented themselves over and over, to great success, and that's why people continue to bet on them to do more of the same.

Don't know if you can buy just any company in US markets, but so many great stocks that are hidden gems in value stock land that don't get talked about enough IMO. I actually used to own CAI, which got bought out. 

Some more besides JOAN: BXC, ONEW, CWH, AQN, FLGT, PRG, X, AMKR. All industries represented in those, and all are growing revenues very, very nicely over the years. And of course, VIAC, F, GM, all of which I like because their multiples are low and they're underestimated given what they could one day grow into if they turn their commodity businesses into multi-pronged service based revenue generating empires.

And I also own some very overvalued stocks (SE, SQ, etc.) to balance it all out. I won't defend the valuations there. But I bought them a year ago because I was buying the business, not the stock. Still holding on based on that rationale.

BTW, you should watch the show Halt and Catch Fire. All about tech across the last few decades",2021-08-06 05:18:50,2021-08-06,0.9936

Lastly: trend is your friend. Taper tantrum will happen. But when? I don't know. No one does. Can't time top or bottoms. I'm not missing out on 10 percent returns in, say, AAPL over a few months.

57,"First, what's interesting is that I come from a similar background and had the same thinking for a long time. But the more I thought about it, the more I reconsidered. 

What's interesting is that the bust cycle for tech already happened. That was Cisco. Every industry has done this. Renewables did a decade ago. Now there are fairly mature revenue generating companies (FSLR off top of my head). 

I think with big tech, it's had those growing pains already. MSFT AAPL especially came back from the dead after that that bust. These are no Cisco. That died basically. Or Standard Oil. Or GM (which I think is reinventing itself nicely, but that's another story). Or INTC (which is dying...). AAPL MSFT AMZN especially have huge dominating services across industries, own Washington and continue to curb any attempt at serious regulation, and continue to create and recreate entirely new industries. Especially with huge profit margins, sticky revenue streams, and TAM that continue to multiply as they suck in every other industry in existence (I'm not kidding: AMZN created and still owns the cloud, and that's not an easy yoke to throw off for clients. MSFT has bought out gaming, AAPL into cars, which may or may not be good idea, and services like banking and chip design). They are in part infrastructure companies, too. They can't fail. Or the increasingly digitized economy fails. One Google outage cost the world billions. For all of that, I'm happy to pay the multiples you put out. They're peanuts. AAPL also has enough cash on hand and the acumen to spend it wisely that the Swiss Central Bank bought millions worth during covid crash (it was huge). You're investing in with something that has the power and wealth of a freaking nation state. Dying? No problem. FB bought out Instagram. 

Moats upon moats, and network effects, and multiple industries all on lock. These are all something former giants didn't have, and not something that could be said of any former businesses that went bust. No one trick ponies here. 

NFLX isn't worthwhile in my opinion. Nor is TSLA. The ones I named are. For all the reasons I gave. NFLX and TSLA are problem children and will go down as Ciscos of our age, I'll concede. VIAC F GM all have cheap valuations and I like them, but they're still value stocks for a reason: they've yet to turn from legacy businesses into multi-revenue stream and service empires. So you do get what you pay for. It's a good bet to make, though.

If you're concerned about valuations broadly, though, you also need to consider interest rates. Both Schiller and Buffett have talked about how given persistent low interest rates in the developed world, the equity premium right now is, well, not a premium. They're the only way to generate returns. And may well remain so. As such, equities are cheap. Schiller PE model doesn't account for sustained difference in monetary policy coordinated globally. 

I also think that while yes, SP 500 is overvalued based on historical basis, it can also be the case that someting like AAPL is not. Also, again, I'm happy to pay the multiples MSFT and AAPL carry for what they are. Those two especially. Rotaion in SP 500 continues to happen daily behind the scenes: from retail back to tech and so on. All depending on current mood of market, and so the overall PE stays high while some sectors come down in value and others go up. It's not all a straight line up.

Here's a guy that's been consistently correct for the past two years on valuations and overall market behavior. He's spot on about the numbers. Very good recent article by him: https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/is-the-market-at-a-top

I don't disagree with you. But to compare something like AAPL to Cisco or to Standard Oil is to completely misunderstand the nature of their businesses and their staying power and what they've become. And that's why Buffett continues to hold an ungodly amount. Did he buy the former giants? I'm sure you respect him, right? üòâ",2021-08-06 04:16:16,2021-08-06,0.9952
58,"You found a great stock, you're in a perfect position to add to it and watch it double again with even more money, and instead you're going to throw it away to put it in VTI?  :))

This is the classic ""sell winners buy losers"" approach.  While VTI isn't a loser overall, it's a big loser relative to the security you sold to buy it.   Would you sell MSFT or AAPL to buy WMT so you could ""lock in your gains""?  Wal Mart's not a loser - it's the largest retailer in the world!

All you're doing is ""rebalancing"" to your less productive investments.",2021-08-06 04:09:39,2021-08-06,0.9338
59,"Thanks for the well written post.   I disagree with it but I‚Äôm happy to have the discussion.  

First of all I should clarify that I am an infrastructure engineer for an internet company.  Not one of the biggest ones, but one you‚Äôve heard of.   So
one way that I follow the advice in your username is not to put all of my eggs in one basket by also investing heavily in tech.

On valuations, that was my ballpark estimate for big Tech.  I looked the numbers up just now and feel really good about them.   Here are the forward/trailing P/E‚Äôs for these companies:

AMZN   59/58
AAPL    26/29
GOOG  30/31
MSFT   32/36
FB         28/26
NFLX    50/54

This averages to 38, without even including smaller and less mature growth tech.  Much less Tesla.

And I personally believe that those P/E‚Äôs are based on optimistically flawed macro assumptions, for reasons OP touched on.  

I understand that P/E isn‚Äôt the only measure of value and can even be a dangerous one (clearly $ZIM‚Äôs 2021 P/E of under 2 is not sustainable).

But it pretty much boils down to what you‚Äôre paying for a combination of sustainable earnings and growth potential.

I know these are considered the best and most revolutionary businesses ever.  But I also know that the same thing has been said about most of the biggest businesses in history.  It was definitely said of Cisco in 1999, but also of IBM and GE and GM and Standard Oil and the Pennsylvania Railroad.  I majored in the history of technology, I‚Äôve always been interested in this phenomenon.

This week I have been reading David McCullough‚Äôs history of the Panama Canal.   

The French Suez and Panama Canal companies were each by far the biggest IPO‚Äôs in history. The same guy, Ferdinand de Lesseps, was the CEO both times.  The Suez was a legendary success, the Panama an abject failure.  A total loss for shareholders, who were still much better off than the perhaps 20,000 employees who died of malaria and yellow fever. 

The French capital raises for the Panama Canal project in the 1880‚Äôs remind me a great deal of recent going‚Äôs on

We especially hear how it‚Äôs different this time late in each business cycle.  And we are very late in this cycle.  I believe we are in the 12th year of it, from the stock market POV, because 2020 only produced a tiny blip and it was off to the races again.

$SPX has returned over 18% CAGR since the 2009 bottom.  The highest ever *rolling* 10 year nominal return is about 20%, and that was in a little higher inflation regime than we had in the 2010‚Äôs, along with much higher interest rates.  Thus I would posit that overall in the last 12 years we have seen the highest 10-year equity risk premium in history.  And roughly tied for the highest ever real returns.

And that‚Äôs using $SPX.  The Nasdaq 100 has been considerably better.  Meanwhile small caps are much more overvalued than big tech, with a higher P/E ratio.  A fair number of straight up zombies litter $IWM.

I could go on for hours honestly.  It seems obvious to me that the overall US stock market must mean-revert, at least in real terms.

Meanwhile I expect commodities, which reached historic relative lows in early 2020, to eventually continue
to mean-revert the other way as they have generally been doing since late 2020.

I don‚Äôt know when it will happen.  This bubble is nothing compared to Japan in 1990.  I try to find investments that will do well regardless, and",2021-08-06 03:58:37,2021-08-06,0.9962

61,"I wrote this for guy above you. But it's folly to write off, say, AAPL as not being an astonishing value long term for what it is.

62,"&gt; How much more of a growth runway can these companies with by far the highest values in world history really have?

First of all, AAPL, FB, MSFT, GOOGL do not have PE of 40 plus. And the same thing you said is what they said 5 years ago. Did trillion dollar companies exist back then? Did entire ad ecosystems like GOOGL has built up exist back then? Did cloud computing exist to this extent? Just examples. 

These are the largest and greatest businesses the world has ever seen for a reason. They cnstantly create and re-create products and whole industries, and usurp what others used to have monopoly on (AAPL moving in to BNPL for instance). And the network effects... They have a growth runway *because* they're large.

The 21st century is the age of tech giants. There will be many long term niche players that will do well to enable these (NET comes to mind). But you display a complete lack of knowledge about tech valuation. Probably to your detriment long term and short term. Look up Beth Kindig, one of the few that's gotten tech right for a while.

I like value investing. AAWW for instance. And shipping stocks were on fire. I also like cash cows stupidly cheaply valued like ONEW, RILY, CWH, PRG. Just examples. But there's a maximum TAM for those services. For what tech does? There's not. It's an economic pie that tech continues to grow by making new sectors to service and then dominating it -- the entire smartphone economy, alongside app economy, semiconductors, ad tech...

Don't bet against that. Also, PE alone doesn't mean a thing. Look at the consistent, multi-year growth and expansion across industries. Not cyclical. AAPL is a freaking bargain if you fully understand what it is and what you're buying into

No one buys AAPL for their .60%, MSFT for their .79% dividend, or NVDA for their .80% dividend. Because you might be able to make more money opening up a Savings/checking account or a CD in a bank.

Remember, the whole reason why you purchased the stock was to gain that dividend yield. Cramer says it best: ""You don't buy a company's stock for its yield; you buy it because it has solid fundamentals.""

Many companies that offer dividends do not grow fast enough for my taste. In my mind, there is an opportunity cost when investing in the slow growing yield stocks. Why place my money in a 3% - 6% dividend yield stock when I can place it in an index fund that mirrors the S&amp;P 500 (7%+) or in a stock that grows my money at 10%+? The opportunity cost in this case would be at least 4%, i.e. I would be leaving at last 4% on the table.

I would consider an index fund (that mirrors the S&amp;P 500) less risky than an individual stock yielding a 3% dividend and the return on your money will be higher with the potential of realizing much higher gains.

Buying an individual growth stock comes with greater risk than a 3% - 6% dividend yield stock. You can end up buying a stock that makes a 3% - 6% move in one day or a 17% move in one week. Spending time watching and studying a few stocks can end up returning quite a bit more money (than 3%-6%) at the end of the year.

151,"Somebody correct me if I'm wrong, but this is my perception.

If I purchase the stock of AAPL, then chances are pretty good that the share/s I purchase are not purchased from the company.  They are most probably purchased from another retailer or institution who owns the stock. This means the money I invested into the stock is going to the holder of that stock.....not the company.  The only time a company makes money off of their stock is when they IPO or release new shares. After that, it is retail trading and other institutions who profit from the shares. Of course, if a company buys back their stock and then resells it for a higher price is another time in which they directly profit from selling shares. 

Odds are that my money is going to a retail trader (like you) who bought the share at a lower price and is trying to cash out or bought it at a higher price and is deciding to take a loss. That share was also probably purchased from another retailer. My money is not going to the company (AAPL).",2021-07-31 21:42:53,2021-07-31,0.9808

Imagine the company losing all of its financial capital.  Without money it can't function.  Companies have loans they need to pay off.  There are rare exceptions, like AAPL is holding enough it cash right now it could pay off its loans if it had a fire sale happen to its stock.

You can watch this happen time and time again.  Eg, Luckin Coffee from last year.  Turns out they were fraudulent.  Investors found out and dumped their stock.  This caused the company to go bankrupt.

I have been using a mac since 2008 when I was 13 and will continue using them because of how easy and user-friendly they are while being relatively fast and great for everyday use. Until another company can come around and make me feel that way it's going to be extremely hard for me to switch to google or microsoft or linux based systems. This is not even taking into account everything else with Apple -- I love their computers and dont see that ending for the next 5 years. Thats my case for investing in Apple. 

Now Microsoft: This company is very well diversified and although I dont like windows as much I think the cloud space will be huge and them and AMZN are at the forefront. This company has a lot of money and proven to make smart acquisitions such as linkedin and github. They have so much money and bright employees I would not bet against them in the next 5 years.

Now Amazon. Amazon is also expanding into other ventures even if there e-commerce site shrinks in the future. AWS is biggest cloud provider, Whole foods is always crowded. Everyone has Amazon prime and Amazon also has the ability to make great acqusitions. 

Last is the price you want to pay for them. I personally like all of these companies for 5 year outlook. AMZN P/E is a little high right now but it will grow into it. AAPL and MSFT is just time in the market vs timing the market.

170,"Not going to speak to AMD specifically, however the ""buy and hold"" slogan is wildly overrated.  I put it in the same category as the myth ""you can't time the market"".  

Notice that every bank, brokerage, institution, corporation, king, billionaire, trader, hedge fund, university, pension plan, sovereign wealth fund, endowment and government fully ignores these rules.  

Every single one of them ""times the market"".  They strive to buy low and sell high.  So why shouldn't you?  

You ""time the market"" in every other aspect of your life.  You look for big discounts on Black Friday.  You sell your boat at the start of boating season instead of the end, so you can get the best price.  You buy some Christmas wrapping paper on Dec 27 when it's 80% off.  When a baseball card you own goes up in price, you sell it.  It's all common sense.

So why on earth would you not use sense with stocks?

Well, the main one is if you're flighty and random, and you're not paying good attention to the price ranges of your stocks or the economy.  Buying and selling blindly or randomly would be bad. 

But if you're paying attention, and you're disciplined, and you have sober strategies (such as your sell-after-26%-gain rule) then ""timing the market"" is probably a good idea.  It's what every expert on earth does.  

I believe every position should be well researched prior to buying, and then watched continuously.  You watch your pets and kids to make sure they're healthy, you should monitor your stocks too.  You should always have upper and lower exit strategies, and amend them over time.  ""I'll never sell AAPL"" is a bad mantra.  Instead could say ""I won't sell AAPL below $300"".

I don't know the full details of your situation (marital/family status, amount of debt, more precise time horizon for this money, etc) but a general rule of thumb is the younger you are the more high risk/high reward you can be since you have more runway to make up for lost capital. For example, I am 27 with no debt, plan on liquidating a large chunk of my portfolio in 3-5 years for a house, have no wife or kids; and currently have ~20% in what you could call more volitile positions.  

Putting your $30k exclusively into one or more of the 3 tickers you mentioned is fine. There is nothing *wrong* with it, but it is very conservative for a 21 yearold to drop 100% of their investment that way. If you are picking those tickers because you don't want to manage your money and want to set and forget, then there are other options that offer better long term growth options, require less management, and are single stocks like $AAPL, $MSFT, $DIS, or $AMZN.  Those are pretty much set and forget (generally speaking set and forget is the best investing strategy).  

If I were in your shoes and know what I know now, I would first pay off any debt (especially credit card). Then throw ~30% into some mix of QQQ or VOO, ~50% spread across 1-3 stocks that are powerhouse set and forget beasts like apple, Microsoft, or Disney (if they company(s) you pick has dividends turn on DRIP), then the other ~20% into a ""dart throw"" company you think might blow up and become the next big thing. Do your research a bit on this last one, maybe invest in a sector you know about. Then revisit that last company in 1-3 years in your portfolio to see how they are doing.  Feel free to adjust those percentages as you feel.

Please consider how many US companies have massive and/or growing overseas presence, and how increasingly global the economy is.

What's worked for me: keep a couple big-name core ETFs (in the vein of VTI or QQQ) and pick a few more that hit sectors or heavily feature stocks you like, maybe something with a solid dividend to carry you through more difficult times (SCHD actually hits on both of these points nicely and I have it myself), and maybe keep a few individual stock picks if you want to have some fun with it.

For example, I have a reasonably high position in SOXX because I wanted more exposure to NVDA, and VGT because I wanted a higher proportion of AAPL and MSFT; I also hold TGT and COST directly because I have extreme faith in their long term performance, and F because I have some faith and am from Detroit.",2021-07-26 15:48:21,2021-07-26,0.9493

Second: Diversifying your portfolio, consider ETFs.
Third: Your morals or views don‚Äôt matter in the stock market, invest and trade in profitable stocks. Being all in on Cannabis or gaming is a 100% failure plan. 
Fourth: $AAPL is a long term hold stock due to how stable it is, same with $MSFT, $PYPL, $V, etc.
Fifth: Going with expectations of making $20k in less than a year will set you up for failure if you are starting small.
Sixth: View any gains as a plus, don‚Äôt jump ship on stocks every time you see a bit of green.
Seventh: Losing money and having red days is part of the story when it comes to the stock market. I have had days where I gained $1k+, but also had days where I lose $1k+.

377,"Sort of. Anyone can make an android device. Only apple can make iOS devices. We saw how this played out in the PC space already - anyone could make a windows computer. 75% of the market now is Android. Apple is regaining small market share but it's just a cyclical oscillation that occurs due to all the other platforms dropping to zero in the last couple years. E.g. if 5% of Android users decide to give iPhone a try and 10% of iPhone users decide to switch to Android, iPhone still gains market share when it's far enough behind (so you get the feedback effect we see now).

The problem with closed platforms is they will eventually find themselves behind. There are just too many competitors - it's Apple vs. the world. Wearables, automotive, VR, AI capabilities... there are tons of ways the landscape is going to change in the next 10 years and it's highly likely Apple finds itself behind. Camera upgrades and poo emojis can only get you so far - eventually people don't need your new product.

Apple also charges a fee to develop apps. It's free on Android. On Android you can bypass the app store easily and download any app, even from a web address, on iOS it is a massive pain (we see this with fortnite).

Also we are at peak phones now - I only see downward pressure on margins due to the competition. Apple cannot get away with such high margins anymore - the only reason we don't see that (their margin is only slightly falling) is because they've added all these other high margin business to offset it (i.e. their services they've expanded in the last couple years). The reality is they're losing margin on their phones and they won't be able to hide that in their numbers forever (they certainly tried when they changed their reporting two years ago).

So those are my concerns with Apple. I always felt their original PE ratio was correct. Once Buffet got in on them they experienced PE expansion which is irrational IMO and I predict will correct itself at some point.

That's my opinion anyway. I think the market is really messed up right now based on bad speculation.

For reference, I'd say IBM, INTC, AAPL, and MSFT should be way closer in terms of PE than they actually are. Something more in line with reality would be IBM -&gt; 10, INTC -&gt; 14, AAPL -&gt; 18, MSFT -&gt; 22. MSFT and especially AAPL sitting at 30+ is just ridiculous, as is IBM hovering around 25. I don't think INTC is priced that unreasonably but it is compared to everything else right now.

451,"Do you have a Roth IRA (that you control)? I ask because when I was your age, I started contribute the max to my Roth (which is just a basic Vanguard retirement fund), and then the rest I would throw into a brokerage account with the most basic Vanguard set up (60% VTI, 30% VXUS, 7% BND, and 3% BNDX). I considered it all as retirement money, so the only time I ever looked at it was when I was putting in more money and never once thought about taking money out. It was the single best thing I ever did in my 20s because by my 30s, it had grown like 40% and I had a nestegg for a downpayment on a house and all of the (never ending) home improvements. Had I traded on that account or viewed it as money I can spend... it would have never made it.

If I were you... I would have two completely separate brokerage accounts (one Vanguard, one TDA, for instance).  One should be your 'retirement' account (even if it's not technically a retirement account), which you only look at when you're adding money to it. If you did 100% VTI or similar index, you'd be fine, but typically long term portfolios have some allocation of bonds (like BND) in case of market downturns depending on time span (longer time = less bonds). While NVDA, BABA, MSFT and AAPL are great stocks, if you're actually going to hold over a 10-20 year span (downturns and all), I'd rather just invest in the overall market (with VTI or similar) versus just those 4. The other account would be your 'play' account - where you only put in money that you're willing to lose.

I would make sure you have about 3 months of living expenses in a bank account, keep the $4000 in stocks in whatever brokerage you have and have that be your 'play account', then I would open another account and put the rest of the money into a long term account which is just stock and bond index ETFs.

Something for your to consider would be a 'robo-investor' for your long term savings - there are a ton of them but I've used M1 Finance, Betterment, SoFi and Wealthfront and while they differ, they all pretty much accomplish the same thing. You select your goals or time horizon, and it generates a portfolio for you and you can set up an auto-deposit so every week or month it puts in $50 or so. I like M1 Finance the best as you have the most flexibility and can really fine tune the allocations, but ultimately all robo-investors just put your money in some kind of mix of VTI, VXUS, BND, BNDX (or non-Vanguard equivalents) depending on the time horizon.",2021-07-20 21:13:22,2021-07-20,0.9918

Gaming gear market is fragmented, so you can be a leader / dominant player with 17-40% share.

Moat of TSLA and AAPL is priced in in their valuations (thus high P/Es). Moat of CRSR is not priced in. If anything current CRSR valuation implies that CRSR will be declining in the future and losing their market share. So, as long as CRSR is able to just sustain their share, the stock will generate a great return. If they grow their share, the returns will be enormous.

As for TSLA, it will need to successfully launch full self-driving relatively soon to justify current valuation. Only in that case the stock will be able to sustain its valuation (just sustain, not even grow, because these expectations are already priced in).

For AAPL, they also will need to grow faster than economy (probably at \~10%/year) to justify and sustain (just sustain) their valuation, which is overly optimistic, because they just had a covid boost from people buying gadgets for WFH and entertainment from home being trapped indoors during pandemic, and AAPL is already selling their products to everybody in the world, so I don't know what they need to do to grow rapidly at this point.",2021-07-20 18:59:38,2021-07-20,0.7964

488,"One of the main points of investing in index funds is diversification, and you lose this if you're only invested in one stock like AAPL. For example, if rising interest rates cause tech stocks like AAPL to drop, you'll be hit much harder if you're only holding AAPL compared to if you're holding an S&amp;P 500 index fund, since the index fund will include holdings that won't be hit as hard or might even benefit from rising interest rates. It's true that the reverse is true too, that if AAPL shoots up, you would have been better off holding 100% AAPL, but the point is that diversification decreases the volatility of your portfolio performance, which is consistent with your goal of making money safely - the possibility of a single company tanking is generally much more likely than the possibility of the entire US economy tanking.

Also, the S&amp;P 500 is an index, not an index fund, so you don't invest in the index itself. Rather, you invest in an index fund that tracks the performance of the index. The most popular index funds for the S&amp;P 500 include mutual funds like FXAIX and VFIAX, as well as ETFs like SPY and VOO. There are differences among all these possibilities, but generally the mutual funds offer lower fees while the ETFs have better liquidity. If you're holding long-term and not planning on making frequent trades, you should go with a mutual fund to minimize fees. If you think you may be making frequent trades, you should go with an ETF to minimize trading costs.

Not sure exactly what you're referring to when you say that people are not fans of the S&amp;P 500, but it's widely used as a market benchmark. Reddit users tend to skew more tech- and growth-heavy, so they may prefer an index fund like QQQ that tracks the Nasdaq Composite index, which has historically had a higher return than the S&amp;P 500 but is riskier from the perspective that it's more heavily concentrated in certain sectors. It mainly comes down to what types of companies and sectors you want to have exposure to, which depends on your outlook and your risk appetite. Fees, liquidity, dividends, etc. can be further considerations. There's also nothing stopping you from investing in multiple index funds, or investing in both index funds and individual stocks if you want to amplify your exposure to particular individual companies.",2021-07-19 01:27:57,2021-07-19,0.981

That being said, you would still likely be in the green if you bought a stock like $AAPL at current prices and held for 5 years.

This next part is completely speculative and I don't suggest trying to time the market. I believe that stock prices will go back up over the next couple weeks and float around the ATHs until earnings are out with the correction to occur by mid-September.

Info about base currency is on their website:

Can I change the currency of my account?

&gt;No, you'll not be able to change your account's currency if your account is already active.  An alternative would be to close your existing account with us and open a new one in the preferred currency, however, we have temporarily put on hold registrations of new accounts. Thus, if you decide to close your account now, you will need to wait until we start processing new accounts.

You can buy European ETFs of US companies not only with EUR, buy with USD aswell. There is iShares S&amp;P 500 ETF for Europeans. CSPX and SXR8. CSPX uses USD currency, so no conversion happens here, SXR8 uses EUR currency. You can check ETFs for europeans on this website: justetf . com.

And they try to convince you to day trade because if you buy into their Discord chat they'll teach you a guaranteed method to profit in day trading.

The point of the channel is to convince new investors they don't have to do the tedious hours and hours of research you're supposed to do before picking individual stocks, just get ""our apps"".

These silver bullets will always underperform the market. Any educational channel should be teaching you how to research companies and study macro-economic trends.

Personally I am buying more AAPL, nice and slow as it drops.  Companies like AAPL are for the long haul, so buy on dips and buy more if it dips more.  In general if you are buying to keep, the idea is when the Price drops it is on sale, and you buy more.

If you are trading, I think you obviously pulled the trigger too fast, RSI was way to high to buy to trade.

Earlier this year I bought a speculative stock at $47.  Today it's $27.  Today I reviewed the fundamentals and decided to hold.  In the past I would have sold this stock at \~25% loss, but this one got by me and IMO there's a good chance this will be worth $100 in a few years.  So I'll hold.  From a dollar perspective, it's not a threat to my portfolio - the total loss is about 0.5% of my portfolio.  

Just the same I don't intend to let that happen again.  I don't care if it's fucking MSFT or AAPL, you need a limit.  It doesn't matter if it's a great company.  If it's a great company you can always buy it back when it turns around.  The problem is that you have no idea how far it's going to go down.  So find a limit and stick to it.  

That being said, choosing a limit is difficult.  I like 30% or, say, no more than1-2% of your total portfolio.  When I first started investing, a single trade cost $30.  Today they're free.  You can buy 1shr AAPL every month and it costs you nothing, so there's no reason to put yourself in a bad position by, say, spending your whole cash wad to buy 100shr AAPL in one trade and then barfing every time the stock drops $10.

96,"Hello everyone, beginner investor here. I've spent a long time trying to learn about the markets and how to build a portfolio. One tip I've found is not to try to be too clever: rather, work with the market, and especially parts of it doing the heavy lifting. Again, you shouldn't think too hard to find these, but they should just be obvious, like the technology sector.This post will focus on equities, mainly ETFs, although I'm happy to add other asset classes.

QQQ (30%)

SCHX (US Large Cap) (20%)

XLK (Tech Sector ETF) (20%)

SCHA (US Small Cap) (10%)

GOOGL (10%)

AAPL (10%)

From 2012-2019 (a recent and relatively sane bull market) this simple portfolio outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by almost 4% CAGR, and its worst year was -3.07% compared to the S&amp;P's -4.52%. Despite a 5% higher maximum drawdown, my portfolio finished the period $9,405 higher than the S&amp;P from a $10,000 initial investment.

148,"Haha oh nice I‚Äôm flattered! Honestly, while there are concerns of a black swan event like a new vaccine-resistant covid variant, I have a feeling that the global supply chain will recover, even if it‚Äôs a bit slower than expected out to 2023. 

The big thing driving CPI increases really is semiconductors and travel/lodging/fuel. For semis, I feel this is representative of a long-term trend being accelerated by covid. TSMC, Intel, etc. are building out massive capacity to meet this demand and they‚Äôre getting tons of federal funding to do so. Eventually, car prices and things like that will get back to normal but I imagine demand for semiconductors will stay elevated when we reach equilibrium. Personally, I‚Äôve been DCA‚Äôing into SMH and buying semis for the past year or so

When it comes to travel/lodging/fuel, this is just catching up to pre-2019 numbers. Nothing to see here, IMO.

Otherwise, when you consider an environment where interest rates are going to increase, you want stable, cash flow positive companies. Some might disagree with me here but honestly I like big tech. Companies like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, have huge cash piles, large cash flows and are pretty recession-proof as we saw with the Covid crash. If you‚Äôre worried about the high PE, Financial companies are lower PE and tend to benefit in either higher interest rate or higher volatility environments. Can‚Äôt go wrong with VFH if you don‚Äôt want to choose anything in particular. Finally, if you‚Äôre scared but want to stay broadly invested, you can always go with VTI or VT. You could use puts as insurance as well but eh I‚Äôd generally advice against it

So yeah in general I tend to stay invested, really only leave like 10% in cash max. No bonds because if interest rates increase then bonds will just lose value (also I‚Äôm young). I keep retirement accounts diversified and just DCA but for my regular brokerage I‚Äôm pretty tech heavy, though I try to lean toward mostly quality tech names",2021-09-13 19:51:03,2021-09-13,0.992

True, these are preached/marketed by fund managers to scare investor to independently invest in stocks and also attract them to invest in their funds.

Common man, even not an expert about stock market, can beat the market.

For example, my friend , while he was working in Singapore, 20 years before, (not even landed in USA at that time), just bought $70000 to $100000 USD of AAPL shares during 1998-2003 period. He bought some initially, AAPL dipped, he bought again like this $100000 USD at that time. He did not have any stock knowledge, but he knew only one company AAPL for its is famous quality. That is all. He kept the stocks for life, but sold only once - in his life - to buy a home at bay area. Now, he is earning $250000 as every year dividend from AAPL shares.

360,"Don't exercise your option if you're not near expiration as you're just throwing away the extrinsic value. Rather, sell them, and buy the stock with the profits after. Let's look at some numbers. Currently AAPL is at $154. This means your option worth today at $35.85 has

* $35.85 x 100 - ($154 - $120) x 100 = $185 (extrinsic value)

* ($154 - $120) x 100 = $3,400 (intrinsic value)

Exercising now immediately poofs that $185/contract into the void. You're so deep ITM that extrinsic value is 5% of your total value so effectively your position acts like a stock, but with leverage.

If so, hold, and then convert to cash or long.

393,"Less bad then you might think. Most people fundamentally misunderstand what caused the supply crunch thus fundamentally misunderstand who is adversely affected.

Covid didn't suddenly cause a massive spike in demand in order to precipitate a crunch. There was some demand increase in consumer electronics sector as more people purchased equipement to work from home but this is rather minimal and mostly focused on products that people didn't already have and are using lower end semiconductor processes, think webcams, mice, keyboards. Take a look at LOGI to see how this side of the demand increase played out.

Now, so what -actually- caused the supply crunch? Well actually it was automakers and other traditional industries that forecasted a massive decrease in demand cancelling or scaling back their supply contracts. This caused foundries to either spin down for retool or sell capacity to someone else. Both are having a significant impact on auto chips right now which are mostly produced on the less advanced 32nm+ node processes.

The latter is why this affects TSLA less (though they are ultimately still affected which I will address later). They went ahead and purchased the depressed capacity, similarly AAPL/GOOG/QCOM/MRVL all took advantage of this to buy up capacity and lock in cheaper rates for the next couple of years while autos and industrial companies were panicking about a sustained economic recession.

However this still ultimately does affect TSLA (and NIO, LI, etc that took similar approaches) in that purchasing capacity during the dip doesn't protect you from increased requirements going forward due to growth. So while they aren't needing to cut production like traditional autos that stupidly cancelled their contracts they aren't able to grow capacity because the same companies that cancelled are now willing to buy capacity at a premium and are buying everything they can.

This has some big follow-on effects for the semi-conductor industry though, especially combined with developments over the last few years w.r.t geopolitics. Firstly all the big foundries (INTC/TSM/Samsung) are building out new fabs now. These take 2-3 years to online but once they do come online we are going to see a massive supply glut which will drastically lower the prices of NAND, consumer electronics chips etc and free up the older fabs for the next gen of auto/industrial chips which will slowly upgrade from 32nm+.

The other major factor was the whole trade snafu with China effectively banning the use of SMIC and Huahong Semi by US companies, which are major suppliers of these cheaper, less advanced semiconductors. Trump also intervened to have the Netherlands block access to ASMLs latest EUV machines to China which is now causing China to spin up their own EUV lithography efforts which is going to fuck ASML hard in the future. Just look at how Ericson is faring against Huawei... It might take a decade but ASMLs monopoly is probably over because of that boneheaded move.

The boom/bust, crunch/glut cycle is nothing new for semi-conductors but there has just been a perfect storm of factors to make this particular cycle very noticable for the first time of people outside of consumer electronics.",2021-09-04 18:08:45,2021-09-04,-0.8756

29 years old, just started investing this April. I have been adding to my positions weekly in my Roth IRA with Schwab since 04/01. I am currently up 4.76% in that time. 

Trulieve is my highest conviction play by far. I am a user of their products and have witnessed their business quadrupling in size in the past 2 years, and I believe they will continue to grow rapidly and penetrate new markets across the US.

404,"I'll make up an example since I don't have the option chain in front of me. Say you want to buy an AAPL LEAPS. Let's say AAPL is trading at $150. 

I'm going to buy the $135 LEAPs expiring 6-9 months from now, which is at a delta of 0.8. this will cost me a total of $23.00. That means my breakeven would be $158 at expiry. Intrinsic value of the option is 15.00, which leaves extrinsic value to be 23.00 - 15.00 = 8.00. 

You would then find an atm option to sell that would give you a premium of 8.00. This will effectively cover the cost for the extrinsic value, which will give you positive theta (benefit from time decay instead of losing value of your option due to time decay), and you'll have a pure long leg for 1/5th the cost of 100 shares. The atm option would have around a -0.5 delta, so a net delta of .30. Run 3 of these at once and you can pretty much simulate owning 100 shares for 3/5th the cost.

TGT got oversold big time.

Walmart is going to become even bigger. Check out their recent GoLocal launch. They‚Äôre diversifying their revenue streams away from just in store activity.

Costco (unfortunately a bit pricey for me). BJ‚Äôs may be an alternative‚Äî a smaller club chain (I have a few shares).

I‚Äôm actually slightly bullish on Macy‚Äôs only because their move to ecommerce/click and collect has been pretty good. Don‚Äôt have any shares yet though. 

GE possibly. I don‚Äôt have any myself, but the new CEO previously led Danaher. They‚Äôre selling off terrible divisions or closing them, and look to be trying to consolidate their position. Read Lights Out by Thomas Gryta to get an in-depth look at the company.

Albertsons‚Äî second largest grocer in the US, e-commerce is great. 

MSFT‚Äî no question here. Decent dividend, decent performance, continues to grow.

AAPL‚Äî interesting to see their further revenue diversification as they move into cars.

People spend far too much time worrying about their average cost. Forget about it and focus on investing more money into good companies so that money can grow alongside what you've already invested.

More important is to decide how much of your portfolio should be AAPL, vs everything else. Whatever you're comfortable with it could be 10% or it could be 60% I don't know. Whatever you decide, just try to keep it relatively the same so you have a better idea of where you want next months money to go.",2021-09-02 16:28:29,2021-09-02,0.952

So with capital intensive company like Tesla, do u think it‚Äôs the same as companies Apple and NVIDIA? Apple need to outsource to someone to make phones and NVIDIA need factories to build chips also? What do you think about these two companies in the long run? I wanna DCA both of them ( I already DCA-ing MSFT, AAPL and QQQM), yet the AAPL earning calls are little disappointing esp given that the supply chain event. It makes me deterred a bit to keep DCA-ing even tho it‚Äôs most the profitable company in the world without a doubt. Esp I have already had qqqm to cover the apple position for a bit yet it seems apple is the top 3 companies easily, esp with brand and tons of cash flow, cash waiting by the sideline to innovate anything they want. Do u think apple car will come out eventually also?

And what about NVIDIA if u know any? It seems that their future is very bright given best Ai chip and meta verse concept triggered by Facebook/Meta lately. But idk too much about this company or how the world heading forward. Will this shortage of chip keep happening and how is the valuation of this company now? It seems like very overvalued just like Tesla (I don‚Äôt have a problem with Apple and MSFT overvalued because their balance statement, profit, cash flow after all can support it somehow). Yet NVDA is seem both in a bubble like tesla (yes I missed the train on both but I‚Äôm not a speculator). And sometimes revenue growth % and net income growth % can lure some ppl to think their companies are growing very fast given the previous year‚Äôs possible low index base number, including luring me.

The three I mentioned are my highest convictions, and to me are the highest potential return mixed with the highest amount of safety. MSFT, AMD and FB all make crazy amounts of money and have very little debt compared to their income. I will mention that I only just entered on FB last week.

My lesser picks (still high revenue growth, but higher risk) are AI, CRWD, S. I also hold around 15 other companies at the moment, but I would not recommend them as the nest-egg of a portfolio, as they are a little more speculative.

A few I don't own but would recommend would be AAPL, INTU, CRM, SHOP, and PYPL.

I'd also recommend just buying and holding the ETFs VOO or VTI, or even QQQ. Slow and steady wins the race.

1) USA: To put things in perspective: Rav-4 and CR-4 sells about 750K cars per year in the USA. They average about $30K/car.  Will Tesla be able to convert  buyers of $30K rav-4/CR-V to buy 750K model Y EVERY YEAR?? It will be daunting.  they might be able to do with model Y SR: but the revenue will be lower.  Personally: between friends, co-workers, and family: I don't know anyone that drives a &gt;$50K ~~subcompact~~ compact suv.  They all drive rav-4, cr-v, tuscon/santa fe, rogue, forester, outback, escape, etc...I am unsure how many of those folks will buy a model y in the next 3 years....If I had to guess, maybe 1 or 2.  The rest: if they trade in: they will get one of the aformentioned vehicles.  
2) China:  competition is fierce: the model Y already has SR version: revenue for this will be lower.  Berlin will open up: how many $50K model y/model 3 can tesla china sell?  most of model 3 sold in china is &lt;$40K. and model Y sr in china is only $42K. 
3) Berlin:  I suppose tesla can still sell 500K model y/3 every year but competition is also fierce in Europe.  
4) Cybertruck: this probably can only be sold in the USA/Canada: just too big for the rest of the world. there is a reason why #1 pick up truck in the world outside of north america is the Toyota Hilux.  I doubt Tesla can sell 1 million of these every year in the USA 
5) There is a reason the market cap for all automotive (ex-tesla) is only around $1.5 trillion.  Not everyone can afford $60K model y or $45K model 3.  That's why there is a lot of corolla, civic, accord, rav-4, etc. sold.  People who look to buy these cars are not going to cross shop with model y or model 3.  The argument againststhis will be: what if tesla makes model 2?? ok, they can; but revenue will be a lot lower.
6)  Competition: Model Y and Model 3 are good cars. but they are quite expensive.  Tesla can own the upper echelon of electric cars. But luxury competition is there or will be there: ie. Lucid, Rivian, Audi/Porsche, BMW, Mercedes, etc...Yes those may not be #1 but they will get some market share. Then you add RNM, Toyota, hyundai/kia, Volkswagen group, Stellantis, Honda, and a bunch of Chinese companies then it becomes even more difficult. 
7) So I believe the only way for Tesla to achieve such high net income is through other means: this remains to be seen.  over 90% of their revenue is cars though. 
8) Capitalism doesn't allow dominance with high operative margins consistently on things that are capital intensive (ie. cars, airplanes, boats, computer hardware, etc.).  It is software that can do that.  Tesla has to prove that it can make money in software (which they might: they have been able to convince so many people to pay $10K for FSD...will they continue to be able to do so??). 
9) at $1.1 trillion market cap today: at 10% growth in market cap per year: in 7 years it will be $2.2 trillion market cap.  To put things in perspective: AAPL is around $2.48 trillion and they just made about $20 billion this past quarter.  Will Tesla make $19 billion/quarter in 7 years???

But for a company of their size, that's spectacular. Growth will slow, but not stop. That they are trading at 21x forward earnings (compared to say MSFT at 35% with lower estimated growth ahead), tells me the price has room to run just based on valuation.  


The AAPL privacy issue is a good point. It certainly caught SNAP off guard and their stock paid for it dearly. My take is FB is too clever to not find a workaround for tracking. But if they can't it will be an issue.

Not sure what the reference to balance sheet is, but can we agree it's safe to say that are sitting on mounds of cash that is earnings next to nothing on return? My only point is they won't have to take on much extra debt, if any, to get this ball rolling, and their FCF is enough to sustain the project for a while (if the metaverse is mostly software they've got a lot of infrastructure already). But as you said, we don't know, so a lot of both our statements are speculative, which is all we have at this point. Maybe it ends up being a huge waste of capital. I'm betting against that.   


I agree the name changes implies a more speculative feel to it. It seems to me that they are kind of forecasting too far out, trying to stir up a little excitement to get attention away from the bad press and regulation worries (agreed the whistleblower issue is overstated). I do think if the metaverse doesn't pan out, they will change directions rather than go down with the ship. Again, at such a low earnings multiple, they have some margin of safety to use.

Lastly, I have faith that their CEO is probably an android who doesn't sleep and will figure all this out. With a different leader, I would be more worried. I'm by no means a FB perma-bull, but all this name-change and pie-in-the-sky talk of metaverse doesn't have me overly concerned. Good convo, mate.",2021-10-29 22:57:04,2021-10-29,0.9847

159,"Fully understand what you‚Äôre saying and actually agree with you on most of your points, but from the side of someone who is not an investor of FB, but who would have been had this quarter looked different. A different perspective. 

FB is at the end of their ropes, but they never really put money to work towards innovation. The majority of their money went to data/algos/AI to help improve revenue on their platforms (via ads). And they did a really damn good job of that, at the cost of being extremely invasive towards end-user privacy. So much so that Europe as a whole shut down FBs revenue growth through GDPR in 2018. The writing was on the wall. Sure enough AAPL comes along and for whatever reason (heroics, vendetta, dick swinging) decides to fire the shot. 

Now, no matter how bullish you might be on the metaverse or whether or not they even pull it off, the question outstanding is where will the revenue growth to justify FBs future price come from in the next 3-5 years? 

If you listened to the earnings call the only hint we got was from Sandberg who said that (1) they‚Äôre hoping they can build some workarounds to some of AAPLs privacy safeguards and (2) they‚Äôre going to work on showing advertisers how to properly value their ad dollars on FB. Both of those things should be terrifying to a shareholder. (1) So you‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôre looking for a way to invade my privacy again that isn‚Äôt caught by AAPL and (2) You‚Äôre telling me my balance sheet is wrong? Because I have historicals here along with a whole lot of data I got directly from you prior to all of this happening. 

Right now FB feels - to me - like it‚Äôs moving to a speculative play. That‚Äôs really bad. It means institutions might pull out. Which means months of volatility and pump and dump ‚Äúnews‚Äù and ‚ÄúFUD‚Äù until they‚Äôre all square and then FB is a free fall to some equilibrium point. It‚Äôll just be way lower than current price. 

That‚Äôs my take anyway. I should also note that I personally give zero shits about the whistleblower stuff. It‚Äôs like telling me that the whore down the street was whoring.

In 2011, GE's market cap was around $210 B and they were 6th largest company in the world.  Today, GE's market cap is around $114 B and they aren't in the top 30 of largest companies.  

Using Microsoft as the example, MSFT was the largest company in the world in 2000 with a market cap of around $492 B.  Fast forward to 2005, and Microsoft was the 3rd largest company with a market cap of around $267 B.  In 2010, MSFT was the 2nd largest company with a market cap of around $260 B.  Today, MSFT has a market cap of 2.43 T and is the 2nd largest company in the world (just behind AAPL).

1) Lease a car or buy under $4k (probably $5k now after inflation). Buying a car is the biggest waste of money you'll ever make. Always add debt before using capital. That's the best motto in life. Doesn't mean go consume all your income on credit card interest. But leverage the shjt out of your income. It's harder to save than it is to make payments.

2) Putting money into any kind of investment account is a waste. Only do it if you're set on never investing. Investing implies active management whether you're trading or investing in the literal sense. If you're no good at it, sure, create an IRA and throw money into that black hole and forget about it.

3) Too many funds, not enough concentration. Pick 3 stocks/ETFs you like and focus on those. Probably something like: FNILX, TSLA, swap AAPL for a bank (JPM, BAC, GS) and then consolidate all the rest into those.

That would put you on a much stronger footing than where you're currently at.

And that was good justification for predicting AAPL would often beat earnings because it was a proxy for really high demand.

But I just realized the original good point you were reiterating from someone else might not have been saying anything about tesla. But then again maybe it does.. If a low-brow company like hertz wants 100K teslas, maybe other healthier fleet-owning companies will make similar orders in the next few years.

Well - perhaps to your surprise - those number do more than just inflict Rick Santelli upon us every M-F to remind us all that hell is now, on this earth, as he speaks his devil words for 3 solid minutes and then says ‚Äúback to you Sarah.‚Äù Those numbers represent the current yield on government treasury notes. People like (and to be clear I‚Äôm using the word people as defined by the dictionary) market makers, institutional investors, financial journalists, and usually Professor Jeremy Siegel, use those numbers to warn everyone that inflation is coming and then AAPL stock drops 3 dollars then another 1.5 on options expiration Friday and then we don‚Äôt see the Professor again until he‚Äôs needed. 

Well those are government issued treasury bills and bonds. The govt auctions them off and ‚Äúpeople‚Äù and also you and me can buy them. When you buy them you‚Äôre basically lending the govt your money for a term (2/10/30y) and in return they will (1) pay annualized interest of x% (remember those numbers from the first paragraph) semi-annually and (2) be redeemable for the full amount of the bill/bond when they mature. So it‚Äôs like how the bank screws you on loans but in reverse and also normally you‚Äôre not screwing anybody buying T-bonds because their returns are terrible (but stable!). 

Now imagine instead of buying a 30 year tbond and getting 2.071% annually in interest you get 15% (this actually happened in 1981 when rates were at 10.5% or so). Suddenly tbonds look pretty pretty pretty damn good.

383,"Clearly not everyone looking at ARPU. DAU up 4m and ARPU down 5%. 

Next quarter is coming in (at least) 200 million below expectations. Sir, is that with continued growth in DAU? Because guess what that ARPU looks like. What‚Äôs negative growth called on a company at astronomical valuation (even after today‚Äôs AH murder)? 

Spiegel blames losses on being unable to predict what every user in this forum predicted the minute AAPL announced its intentions. Then he goes on to cast more doubt by saying effectively ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt know what we don‚Äôt know.‚Äô Let‚Äôs toss in supply chain issues because everyone else is and we‚Äôre out of ideas. What?

But most of my gains are now from BTC, which I put about 5% of my portfolio into in 2017. Crypto now represents about 70% of my wealth. 

If you diversify, your portfolio will basically match the market. This is good, because it makes you average. Being the 50th percentile of investors is better than being in the half of investors who are below average (the mean more specifically), hence why it‚Äôs the general recommendation. 

But if you focus on growth opportunities, you can far exceed average market returns. But you can also blow up your account and end up with nothing. I almost did in late 2012 (bad AAPL call options), and then bet the farm on Tesla and made it all back and more.

400,"1. You will fail.
2. You will lose money.
3. You will feel stupid.

Of course, you will also succeed, make money, and feel way smarter than  you are...

1. I think learning on your own is a much better tack to take.  You gonna be doing this for decades so the best time to learn is now.  There are huge amounts of resources online to learn what's going on.  And you'll never know all of it unless you actually work in the industry...  I've been doing it for 20+ years and still learn new things all the time.  
2. Most brokerages offer no fees on stock trades these days -- it's fine to do it through your bank, or pick a brokerage, or whatever.  If you're doing it yourself and not using an advisor, it doesn't matter all that much which you choose as long as there aren't fees.  I use Schwab which has actual brick and mortar locations, but I haven't actually been inside one in close to 10 years.  Opening an account is no more complicated than opening a bank account.
3. A brokerage account is like a bank account with extra options (to do things with your money like buy stock), so no real limitations and no tax benefits.  IRAs are retirement accounts with tax benefits, but also restrictions about how much you can put in, when you can take money out, etc.  They come in two flavors -- Roth and Traditional.  The differences are important but you'll probably want to read about them specifically.  401ks are like IRAs, but they're done through your employer, generally subtracted right from your paycheck.  They also come in those two flavors -- Roth and traditional.  Many employers will do things like matching -- for instance, my employer will match any money I put into my 401k up to 4%, so I make 4% more simply by electing to shove 4% of each paycheck into the 401k.  The caveat being that I don't see that money until retirement, of course... But hey, it's still free money.  
4. Money you don't need.  Traditional advice is you should have a rainy day fund for unexpected car repairs, etc.  Usually 3-12 months depending on who you ask and how conservative they are.  Then after that, shove all excess money into things like your employer's 401k, your IRAs, your brokerage account.  

Order and amount will differ depending on your situation.  Usually the order is something like: 

1. Enough into 401k to get any company matching (free money!)
2. Max out Roth IRA for the tax benefits, plus the money you contribute is easily accessible in an emergency (earnings not)
3. Enough to max out 401k
4. Brokerage

But your situation may be different.  For instance, I swapped #3 and #4 quite a while as I was saving for a down payment for a house.

In terms of picking what to invest in:

1. I'd probably start with just shoving it into an index fund of some sort -- VOO tracks the S&amp;P 500, or VTI includes all American stocks.  There's huge overlap between those, as the S&amp;P 500 is 500 of the largest US companies, so VTI is like 87% of the money into VOO, and the remaining 13% into smaller US companies.  

2. You can stop there, and you'll do better than a hell of a lot of investors.

3. If you want to try and beat that or change your risk profile, the next logical place would be narrower funds or funds with exposure to things you don't already have exposure to.  Like VT invests in ALL companies, including overseas.  or VFH is specifically financial sector stocks, or VGT is tech sector stocks, or BND is a bond fund, etc.  (I'm just using vanguard funds because they're generally good -- others are also good)

4. You can try to pick specific companies, like if you're a believer in Apple, you can just directly buy AAPL stock.  But you'll already have exposure to it in those other funds you're already invested in, so you can kind of think of it as just weighting your portfolio more heavily in one direction than another.",2021-10-20 15:47:58,2021-10-20,0.992

In extension, much of the consumer market requires people to over extend themselves constantly to maintain current momentum. If everyone is saving and investing, the market would go up first and then completely collapse as the actual economy slows way the fck down. Covid caused a bit of this but it's unlikely to last as it's currently bottlenecked by supply shock, rather than people's financial knowledge or explicit intent in lower demand. You might think some successfully invested person eventually spends the money on a Porsche or something more in total, but the reality is that type of spending trajectory will kill a shit ton of businesses and product categories today. To the point the entire market might collapse or take tremendous hit it may or may not be able to recover from. 

Consumerism is critical to US capitalism, and extreme consumerism to a solid degree require financial illiteracy. If you are an investor, you shouldn't want the average person to smarten up in these areas. AMZN may crumble, AAPL could collapse.

Anyway, what‚Äôs I‚Äôve learned along the way so far:

-take your wins. A win is a win even if you could have had more

-stop your losses

-avoid crypto, especially in market accounts where you can watch your money bleed away over the weekend with nothing to do about it

-don‚Äôt use products that don‚Äôt give you proper tools (so, brokerages that don‚Äôt support stop losses often have no/very low fees, but this comes at major time or monetary costs. Not worth it)",2021-10-17 15:46:13,2021-10-17,0.3448
456,"I would be paying $644 per month with those debts. Whether I cash in my stocks now to pay the debt and re-fund my portfolio with the monthly payment amount or whether I continue making monthly payments on the debt, it will take me a little over ten months to complete either. 

To me, the small amount of time would be negligible. The amount of interest I‚Äôd pay over those ten months may be a wash over the gains in the market.  Ten months to pay down debt = ten months bringing my portfolio back on track. 

If I made $3k take home a month, the debt would be a significant portion of my pay. I imagine I would be less inclined to throw 21% of my income back into my portfolio every month, so that ten months to refund my portfolio would probably be longer. 

Oh yeah, and I would have to remind myself that I did this before around the time of the GFC when I was in my late teens. I cashed in about a thousand bucks of BIDU and a share of AAPL to buy a big tool box to show the shop owner I was committed to them and the career. Then BIDU skyrocketed, had a 1:10 split, then rocketed again, all while AAPL did it‚Äôs AAPL thing. Oh yeah, and I never refunded my account with no good reason to tell you why I didn‚Äôt do it. Looking back, maybe I thought that couple grand didn‚Äôt mean much. 

Having been there and done that, it‚Äôs hard for me to say I‚Äôd sell my portfolio again knowing what I did the first time. 

Of course, if the market tanks and I‚Äôm still on the hook for the debts then my backup plan is gone, but that‚Äôs a risk my long-term self should be willing to accept.
 

Edit: I would also take a look at how much I‚Äôm allocating to cash versus stocks.  If having such little savings is going to tempt me to sell my portfolio, then I should increase my savings. Having more savings doesn‚Äôt hurt my taxes, but selling my stock for a profit does. Though the stocks could have been gifted to me. If I don‚Äôt want to sell them, I need to do something to prevent me from selling them like increasing my emergency fund. 

Maybe I only sell a small portion to cover the braces and keep the rest? That extra $244 a month could help a lot to my mental state, and the snowball method can keep me motivated.",2021-10-17 12:28:50,2021-10-17,0.9062

Someone can buy a share my etf ABC and trade it in for units of apple and microsoft which my etf is composed of. Because of this, if my etf goes down in price but aapl and msft go up, they can get them for a huge discount by redeeming my etf for shares of apple and msft at a low price, and instantly selling those units for a huge profit.

468,"Well the beauty of index funds is you just buy buy buy and never sell, regardless of up, down, or loop de loop.  I own SCHB, SCHA, and DGRO and will never sell.

I also own one ""never sell"" stock (AAPL) and there are certainly more examples of those types of companies.  Buy and only buy.  

But for more ""trades"" or stocks you're uncertain about or concerned about locking in profit?  It can be very tough to know when to sell.  Sucks to watch a 20% gain shrink back to zero or negative, but oftentimes that's necessary to enjoy those big gaps up (would have made me a millionaire with ATVI &amp; AMAT). Also happened to me recently with CRM.  Up nice amount, pulled way back, then rocketed back up.  Still holding.

At the end of the day it's best to just focus on Index funds and leave a small % (5, 10, maybe 20) to play around.

3,"This is true for one and only one reason, the top 5 stocks in the market are nearly entirely responsible for the market being at ATH. The majority of stocks, something like 3 out every 4, are trading at or below their 200ma. The real reality is that the top 5 are propping up the market, most stocks are trading near 52 week lows while the top 5 have been heavily pumped and teeated as cash havens. Many many stocks are down 30, 40, 50+% over the last 2 months, the reap question is what happens market wide when those top 5 companies come down, will all those beaten down stocks drop even further or will money rotate? The market could correct 10-20% just by virtue of those over overbought top 5 coming back down to match the heavily sold off remainder of the market. We saw it Monday near the end, the AAPL sell-off nearly single handedly accounted for the market drop, especially at the end, with $50 BILLION in market cap lost in a short period of time. 

So no, the market itself is not at ATH right now, the top 5 companies which account for more than 20% of the indices are very very high while the majority are now negative for the year.

The thing is, AR isn't going to be easy or cheap. Meta and Apple actually have a very difficult road in front of them, because they're 100 percent consumer facing with their efforts. Microsoft by choosing to tackle enterprise instead of consumer, they can keep their prices high (and their margin), and also try to perfect the technology before being forced to miniaturize it too much for consumer appeal. Meta and Apple will be forced to make many concessions to make their AR glasses ""acceptable"" to be worn in a Starbucks or grocery store.

I've only been investing since January like a lot of people here.  Hoping for some feedback and answers to a couple of questions I've been tossing around in my head .  

1) Three of these are in QQQ is there a similar play that has less overlap?

2) I'd like to get some cyber security in here and really like PANW and NET for the products they offer  but feel their valuation is a little crazy.  What are the thoughts on these two or alternatives ?

3) I'd also like to get some diversification but I'm not knowledgeable about other sectors and wonder what non-tech stocks or ETFs people have high convictions about.  I'd really like to get into some ""shovel plays"" along the supply line around electronic vehicles that aren't tied to specific car, country ,or manufacturer (supplies a raw material or something to the US as well as countries that are more early adopting  EVs ).  But really anything that isn't tech that would be a good research topic.

Let's be clear, if you're gonna hold these stocks for 5-10 years, chances are very small you'll go wrong.

I'd be surprised if these stocks don't take a 10-20% beating somewhere in the short term (2 years), potentially as early as Jan/Feb as people buy back into the stocks they sold for tax loss harvesting.

I don‚Äôt wanna be a dick but you really just talked about MSFTs growth opportunities but did Apple dirty here. IMO they could be the king of wearables for decades to come, the Apple Watch has a lot of associated health related patents (imagine if the watch can measure temps, blood sugar), and their AR tech could be a huge new revenue stream as well. They‚Äôre also diversifying into many service revenue streams. 

Not to disparage MSFT I agree they have plenty of growth opportunity, I think AAPL does as well too.",2021-12-14 23:29:03,2021-12-14,0.9621

21,"I think MSFT is the strongest one given it has multiple growth angles going on. Starting to muscle in on cloud, workflow automation, team productivity stuff, which are all very tangible and then some speculative stuff built in with metaverse. 

A lot of the AAPL buying pressure is people considering it to be a safe haven/always go up company, and that always leads to bursts of volatility. But in the long run it should continue to grow/make the right business moves.

NVDA valuation is pricing in a lot of expected revenue from metaverse stuff we don't know if it's going to turn out well or not, so that is speculative. They do have some tangible stuff going on there with Omniverse's beta, it just depends on if you believe it'll be widely adopted.

PYPL and V are a little tough to call because we're talking about the overall secular trend - if we go a decade out, are they going to be growing still given how much disruption is happening in fintech?

They are big enough players to buy their way. But they're such huge companies it's hard to judge ahead of time - you buy a small new fintech company growing revenue 40%+ year after year, but your main business is seeing slower growth. In theory they are a bit more robust in an inflationary environment, but that's a separate thing and might be less important compared to the fundamentals of their growth.

PYPL's growth was around 18.5% from 2015 to 2020, before competition from Square really started to intensity. But they are still growing. To me it's about how many plays they got in their toolbag. So similar moves to offering Venmo as a payment option in Amazon -&gt; ok. There's a lot of ecommerce companies popping up across the whole globe so if they keep doing that with say MercadoLibre, with Canoup, etc, they can keep finding ways to bolster their activity and adoption rates, embed themselves everywhere.

So I kind of look at it like their presence and sheer size means they will likely have a place at the table with all these growing ecommerce giants in Asia, South America, etc.  I think, in theory, they grow with ecommerce sector, and their scale helps them there vs. perhaps the smaller less proven fintech companies. Digital payments is a big enough market people should be fine with accepting a tradeoff between having a piece of that market share and reduced CAGR -&gt; it's a matter of if the institutions see it that way too.",2021-12-14 20:27:22,2021-12-14,0.992

36,"Individual stocks didn't do horrible in 2021, stop with this. I can't believe how many people are saying this. Many, many stocks did well, mainly great companies with great business models.

Look [here](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=141&amp;o=-marketcap). Of the top 20 (by market cap) stocks, only 2 were negative (with WMT ""only"" 2% down YTD, the other being BABA which dropped over 50% but it is a very specific case).

Yes, many of those still underperformed the market, but even outside of growth / tech stocks there were stocks that did very well (this is from top 40):

* BRK is up 28%
* JPM is up 32%
* UNH is up 42%
* HD is up 53%
* BAC is up 53%
* PFE is up 50%
* XOM is up 40%
* TMO is up 39%
* COST is up 49%
* LLY is up 55%
* ABT is up 27%
* DHR is up 42%

Of the top 40, there were 2 additional stocks that are negative YTD - MA (-3%) and DIS (-17%).

These are just stocks that are not tech / growth stocks, so it excludes AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, TSLA, ADBE and others. 

The ones are listed are pretty much boomer stocks (not in a bad way, I hold some of those) that have been around for *decades* and performed incredibly well this year.

So, no, contrary to what I've seen parroted here in these past two weeeks, individual stocks didn't do horrible. Overvalued growth stocks did horrible. I hold some of those, too (I'm down YTD on MA, V, SQ, CRSP), not to mislead anyone; and I'll keep holding them - but I have some other stocks, too, including 4 of those listed above (BAC, JPM, COST, DHR). I have some others that did well (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, ADBE, ISRG, BAM).

Individual stock holders as a collective didn't do horrible. Only those whose portfolios were overweight on tech growth stocks. My losses from the stocks that did bad were far offset from my core/value picks and I'm buying some of the losing ones as they're falling to hopefully outperform in the long term.

If you're down this year, it's not because you picked stocks, it's because you picked bad stocks. Stop FOMOing into outperforming growth stocks just because of their momentum and hype you see on YT / Reddit / Tiktok / Insta. I'm not against growth stocks, I hold several.

I think a lot of newer investors were trying too hard to beat the market, and ended up over risking and over leveraging themselves which lead to certain speculative bubbles that have popped while the indices have been on a tear.

In 2017, as a newer investor, I chased hype and spec, so I understand the hungry mentality of someone who begins investing in the greatest bull market of our time. You just want more. But in reality, in a bull market, there's not a lot of need to over risk.

Buying and holding big tech and certain industrials would have had your money growing and compounding at an extraordinary rate. People just get impatient is these types of markets.

That being said, I definitely have over exposed myself to risk in this market and it wiped away alot of my gains. If people want to make high risk plays, they must accept that they most likely will not get the returns. Stupid games and stupid prizes and such. Where if you instead, sat down for 1 hour and caught up on aapl, qqq, spy, and initiated leaps and shares early, you would have no stress and a investing account that would have you worrying about taxes since you've made so much money in less than a year.

Edit: I will also add, that newer investors tend to try and pick individual stocks without properly analyzing them, and we all saw a lot of capitol destruction happen when the spac bubble burst, which hurt many individual and younger investors who bought exciting stocks that they believed in. Not all of these companies will go bankrupt, but many are still in a stage of price discovery and volatility, which means more experienced traders will take advantage. 

Many of my friends who hopped into investing on the covid hype tried to buy crazy stocks with zero earnings, while I urged them to buy the CVS, and Exxon's in 2020.

So I have benefited enormously from AAPL - there were a lot of pullbacks during the last 6 years, and sideways trading periods. but I took on the Buffet notion of stocks as owning assets in a company and not as abstract symbols where you focus on the ups and downs of price, but look at the long term.   i held through it all, ignored the 2020 crash and just kept going about my life.. obviously the time since then has accelerated everything greatly.  My apple shares unrealized gains are spectacular. Are we finally ""too toppy"" at 180 and a 3 trillion dollar market cap? Maybe, but i find it hard to pull the trigger. Not just because I still believe in AAPL for the next few years, even if there is a pullback, but also because it feels like selling would be going back to the old me that tried to time the market. Maybe I am foolish but until Berkshire dumps its 40 percent portfolio share of AAPL I might reconsider.. until then maybe it is better to just remind myself that stocks are going to  both down and up but the real question is .. what will it be worth 5 years out?",2021-12-12 18:58:08,2021-12-12,0.7688
143,"Be careful with this sentiment. It seems like everyone suddenly thinks AAPL is invincible. I hold AAPL and plan on never selling, and definitely won't be trying to time  it (unless it gets very cheap). But even AAPL goes through periods of greed and fear. Not so long ago (early 2019) there was a massive sell-off for AAPL (I loaded up back then as it was a really good deal) and the stock didn't get back to its ATH until over a year after the previous ATH in Sep 2018.

That was a short while ago, and even though the company grew a lot since then and it has quite different fundamentals going on, I wouldn't be so confident that it's a completely safe investment (again, I am a long-time holder and don't plan on selling). Ffs, I've seen AAPL referred to as a cash-like investment *three times* this week! It's not and it never will be. It's a damn good company, but it's incredible how overly optimistic people became about this stock seemingly overnight (well, over the last month, really). Hell, even going back to October or summer, you wouldn't see anyone refer to it as a savings account or a cash-like holding. It's all just an echo chamber and the current state of the market (with MSFT and AAPL outperforming recently)  makes everyone think it will only go up. Long time, sure, that's very likely and I am very confident in that. But even this year it had a period of almost -20% over a couple months. Just two months ago, there was a -10% correction. There will be more of those, so stop treating it like cash. I don't think you'd post a comment like this just two months ago.

Edit: i just remembered that there was actually a pretty popular post about how Apple needs to radically innovate to prevent stagnation, just a few months ago. The sentiment was generally that Apple is not being innovative enough. Not much happened since then (other than Macbooks and one earnings report), I think, but the stock is up significantly and the sentiment is somehow that it's free money with no risk.

I think people would put the money into AAPL (instead of an ETF or cash) while they wait to take it out and invest back into the companies they sold out of (assuming they still believe in those companies and only wanted to reduce taxes).

It is possible that AAPL will correct downwards near the end of the month or the beginning of January.

Microsoft‚Äôs Windows is still absolute leader in PC OS market share. Enterprise customers are still going to stay on Windows for most part. Office 365 is a Cash cow.

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

202,"Fair enough

A leap on a strong company is way better than buying shares of meme stocks though.

You can always buy a deep ITM leap, those are much more risk averse.

That Ford call I mentioned is likely going to make money.  The Ford Lightning is basically sold out till 2025.

Only reason I mentioned options is because your capital is low.  Not much you can do with $755.  Even a 30% annual gain next year would not break you even in the shares world.  Here's a couple of conservative AAPL calls I bought for my mom in February:

https://i.imgur.com/tTuUOu5.jpg

Up over 100% in less than a year and still over a year left till expiration.  Options don't have to equate to gambling if you buy smart.  Another option I'd consider is a Ford 17c expiring in 2024.  That one is much safer, but you can only afford one.  Other than that, I'd stick to ETFs, but you probably already know that and wouldn't make this topic if you wanted to just put your money in VOO.

Go to a stock screener - filter nasdaq stocks.

Alternatively, you can do your own maths on the nasdaq 100.

AAPL = 31.5%

MSFT = 50%

GOOG = 69%

AMZN = 7%

TSLA = 42%

Nasdaq 100 has done 25.5% YTD

300,"&gt; Even if AAPL doesn't invent self driving, they will probably perfect the technology. Especially when they will have the bankroll to pay for talented teams and employees from other companies in the future.

Many in the industry have been working on self driving for well over 10 years and have yet to bring anything to market. It's not going to be simple for Apple to just ""perfect"" technology that no one has been able to get working yet. Apple hardly has a perfect record either, they have a lot of failures in their past.

imo I think there's an absurd amount of optimism baked into the Apple car by investors (given how much the news of it caused the stock to shoot up), even though it'll literally be at least until 2025 at a minimum before they bring in even a single dollar of revenue from it per Apple's own timeline. Google is a great company to, but they've been spending something like 15 years on their self driving vehicle, and their management seems to be losing faith in the project given how they're letting outside investors buy into Waymo, despite the fact that they have plenty of cash on hand available to pour into Waymo so that they can keep 100% of the profits for themselves.",2021-12-09 15:24:28,2021-12-09,0.9666

305,"&gt;Even if AAPL doesn't invent self driving, they will probably perfect the technology. Especially when they will have the bankroll to pay for talented teams and employees from other companies in the future.

I don't think this is going to happen.  Creating a self-driving stack via ML is orders of magnitude more complex than engineering a phone or writing software for iOS. You can't just hire a few engineers from the competition and turn around an improved product after a year or two.

You need petabytes of real-world training data and teams of people to comb through it just to have a chance. And even with all that, success is not guaranteed - look at how much Tesla has struggled despite all the resources and talent they are throwing at the problem. Making small tweaks to the learning algorithm can result in drastic and unintended changes to the behavior of the software.  Self-driving is one of the hardest engineering problems of our time since it's basically attempting to create AI.

Based on that, IMO the most likely path forward for Apple is they design the hardware and interface but license the self-driving software from whoever is willing to sell it to them. They are clearly not going to be one of the first people to market with a self driving stack, so I think they should focus on what they do best, which is designing hardware and creating a great UX.",2021-12-09 14:50:56,2021-12-09,0.9791

307,"Even if AAPL doesn't invent self driving, they will probably perfect the technology. Especially when they will have the bankroll to pay for talented teams and employees from other companies in the future.

I don't personally own any apple products (Im not big on owning tech and gadgets at this point in my life), but I own the stock because everything they bring to the table works and integrates seamlessly with their other products. 

That synergy, and the fact that I believe they will capitalize big time on other companies inventions/achievements (think AI, electric cars, smart homes, solar, medicine UI, cloud storage, etc), is why I buy and hold AAPL.

Edit: I get it. People are rooting for Tesla. My suggestion that AAPL perfects self driving is not that AAPL will have self driving next year, in 5 years, or even 20 years. That suggestion is more of a ""standing on the shoulders of Giants"" line of reasoning. What I am saying is that once self driving is released, is fully autonomous (unlikely) or common enough on the road, AAPL can come in and adopt it as their own using superior software that integrates well with their devices, technologies, and other goals. I'm not saying there will be an ""iCar"" or even an automobile plant, I'm saying that one way or another, there will be vehicles on the road with seamless integration with apple products and practical uses for technologies/software they have already developed or will develop on the future.",2021-12-09 14:19:34,2021-12-09,0.9623

Yes, the biggest risk of selling puts is the stock crashes and you buy $14,000 worth of shares that are now worth a fraction of that. Or, you buy to close the contract at a **large** loss. This is unlikely with AAPL which is why the premium is quite low in contrast to more volatile stocks.

Truth is, each opportunity should be judged on its own merits and every opportunity is unique.

358,"Some good responses here. One thing I'd add is that it can be tricky to use this method to actually enter the stock when it's a longer expiration.

If you say ideally wanted it to be exercised on you at say $130, and it hit that price in the next weeks (The put being In the Money) - it might not actually get executed because, in this hypothetical scenario, there's a lot of extrinsic (time) value till March expiration. The long party might just hold, and then price could spike back over $140 and it could turn out that was their only chance to exercise the put.

So you have to be fine with the tradeoff of getting the premium, vs. the possibility of the stock crashing and you being long at a high cost basis, or actually wanting to get in and eke out the premium, but not getting exercised. This is AAPL so it crashing far below the exercise price seems unlikely, but the scenario I'm laying out (where it's briefly in the money, too far ahead of expiration, then bounces back, strikes me as not unreasonable.)

Selling puts is fine if you're purely trying to capture the premium and avoid getting exercised whatsoever, but not always great if you're trying to 'get paid for buying the stock'.",2021-12-08 00:45:03,2021-12-08,-0.5091

362,"Yeah, you're right, AAPL's PE isn't high compared to some stocks, but it's very high when you consider that until recently it's always traded at much lower multiples, ~10-15. Most of AAPL's growth in recent years has come purely from multiple expansion, not earnings growth which is worrying because multiple expansion isn't sustainable and multiples are likely to come under pressure with tightening monetary policy.

I'm also extremely sceptical of AAPLs ability to grow over the next decade like it did in the last decade and it will need to show strong growth to justify such a relatively high multiple. In my opinion it's unlikely they're going to increase their share of the smart phone market this decade which is where the bulk of their revenue currently comes from, and for the last few years a lot of their increased revenue has come from selling products at increasingly higher price points, again this is unsustainable and they'll need to find new revenue streams to continue their current growth rate -- which I'll add already isn't that high when compared to other software stocks trading at similar multiples. It's completely possible a new killer product and healthy services growth will justify the higher multiple, but its current price doesn't give much room for safety.

To be clear the only reason I flagged up AAPL as a risk for the indexes is simply because it's the largest holding in the S&amp;P500 with a weighting of something like 6.5%. If AAPL's PE just drops back to a high historic level (20) that kind of move in the largest holding would weigh on the indexes. I don't think it's a bad investment if you're not too concerned about beating the market and you're just looking for a stock that's relatively safe which you can hold long-term, but that's not what I'm looking for personally.

But it's not just AAPL, TSLA and NVDA together make up a little more than 4% of the index and no one would argue those stocks are cheap. Could they keep going up? Sure, but with rate hikes on the horizon I suspect they'll struggle to see returns as strong as in 2020 &amp; 2021. To a lesser degree I'm also worried about about stocks like MSFT because even though I think they'll continue to see strong growth for years to come they're also trading at much higher multiples than they have been historically, so again, there's just less room for upside even with decent growth. I could point to a few others I'm worried about -- you mentioned COST and that's another large cap stock trading with a much higher multiple than it has historically -- but generally when I look at the top holdings of the NASDAQ and S&amp;P500 I don't see much opportunity for growth and quite a lot of risk.",2021-12-07 23:39:10,2021-12-07,0.9826

396,"People here pay way too much attention to daily moves. Those who were selling last week because markets were down are now finding out why that was probably a mistake. Likewise, those who have been thinking that markets only go up are now starting to see hints of normal market volatility returning and will understand why a portfolio consisting only of TQQQ or ARKK might not be as obvious as it seemed earlier this year.

I'm always bullish in the sense I'm always invested, but I'm not always invested in the same stuff and tend to frequently rotate in and out of positions where new risks and opportunities emerge. The past week was a great time to unload some winners like TSLA and NVDA and rotate into something which may preform better in next year's market. Who knows or cares if indexes will hit ATHs any time soon. I'm sure they'll do fine long-term but they do seem expensive to me right now. I personally think stocks like AAPL are looking very pricey, but who knows, AAPL is great company and may prove its worth its current valuation. But it's not just AAPL I'm worried about there are a lot of large stocks in the indexes right now (NVDA, AAPL, TSLA) which all seem very pricey compared to historical valuations. Even if indexes do well, there's just far more value to be found picking smaller individual stocks for the time being I believe.

So yeah, I'm bullish in some sense. I suspect indexes will lag going forward, but I've managed to take advantage of recent volatility and feel I'm now positioned well for the next few months in the market.",2021-12-07 13:58:08,2021-12-07,0.9926

401,"Hmm.. I am in the stock market for only 4 months and I never talked about a market crash..

There won't be a crash, I think people are missing the fact that while the stock market has been going up a lot, it is mostly the big companies that have been pulling the weight upwards. 

Think how much MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA and NVDA have gained YTD while the VTI hasn't done even close to most.

YTD:    
VTI is up 22%.    
AAPL is up 28%.    
GOOGL is up 66% (GOOG about the same).    
TSLA is up 38%.  
MSFT is up 50%.  
NVDA is up 129%.

These are only part of the companies that pulled the stock market up this year and they are massive companies, look at how the rest of the stock market is doing in order to lower the percentage gains of those companies.

VB (small cap) is up 15.5% YTD.    
VO (mid cap) is up 21% YTD.

The Russell 2000 index is up ""merely"" 13% YTD (down about 10% since the beginning of November).

The entire market looks as if it is in a bubble or at least doing extremely well, but it only looks that way.  That is also without mentioning [record year for share buybacks](https://www.ft.com/content/dd9a7b72-1f9b-4b66-ac75-200d1653ce6f), making it go up even higher than it would naturally.

**My Foreign ""ETF"" Description (bold means that‚Äôs the company's primary sector):**

To keep this relatively short I only highlighted in parenthesis certain business segments that I thought were interesting and/or worth a mention.

* ‚ÄãADRNY: **Cons. Staples (grocery)** &amp; Cons. Discretionary (e-commerce)
* ANCTF: **Cons. Staples (convenience stores)**, Energy (gas &amp; EV charging), Healthcare (Cannabis)
* DQJCY: **Cons. Discretionary (discount dept. stores)**  &amp; Financials
* JMHLY: **Industrials,** Cons. Discretionary, Cons. Staples (grocery &amp; all 7-11's in HK, Singapore, S. China, &amp; Macao), Energy (coal), Financials (fintech), Materials, Real Estate (commercial, mixed-use, office, high-end residential, luxury retail), Tech, Utilities
* MKKGY: **Healthcare (biotech &amp; pharma)**, Materials (automotive, building, coatings, cosmetics, lab, LCD, pigments, semiconductor)
* MTNOY: **Comm. services**, Financials (fintech &amp; insurance), Tech (payment processing &amp; IT)
* ORKLY: **Cons. Staples (food &amp; consumer goods)**, Cons. Discretionary, Energy (hydropower), Financials, Materials, Real Estate, Utilities
* VCISY: **Industrials (concessions, construction, consulting, defense, engineering, facility management, infrastructure, sanitation, shipping, space)**, Cons. Discretionary (duty-free shops), Energy (hydropower, nuclear, solar, wind), Financials, Materials, Real Estate, Tech, Utilities
* VWAPY: **Cons. Discretionary (cars)** &amp; Financials (banking)
* WFAFY: **Cons. Discretionary,** Cons. Staples, Energy (LNG &amp; LPG), Financials, Healthcare, Industrials, Materials (chemicals, gold, fertilizers, lithium, wood), Real Estate (retail REIT), Utilities, Alternative Investments (art)

**Reason for investing:**

* AAPL, GOOGL, LMT, MSFT, TROW: Stable US companies, with varying levels of future growth potential. Despite having exposure to these companies through VTI, these are companies that I personally want to have a stake in.
* ADRNY: I wanted a stable and strong cons. staples company. They‚Äôre the 2nd largest supermarket chain in the world, behind Kroger's; and one of the world's top 50 fastest growing retail companies (#34).
* ANCTF: I wanted access to cons. staples sector (gas stations/convenience stores). They have global reach and management that is forward thinking - expanding into the relatively nascent industries of EV charging &amp; cannabis. They are one of the world‚Äôs top 50 fastest growing retail companies (#46).
* JMHLY, ORKLY, WFAFY: Large, stable, and extremely diversified conglomerates with good management,  slow growth potential, and good dividends. They allow me to safely gain access to various frontier &amp; emerging markets in Europe and Asia, with little geographical overlap.
* MKKGY: Exposure to healthcare, materials, and semiconductor sectors. MKKGY is an important link in the global supply chain due to the enormous variety of materials they make. (For example, today nearly every semiconductor is made using materials from MKKGY.)
* VWAPY: I think they will be a major EV player in the future.
* VCISY: I wanted a company with good financials that not only builds infrastructure but also operates and manages infrastructure concessions (many of which last for decades). Vinci builds, finances, manages, and operates: airports, highways, stadiums, dams, street lights, railways, etc. I also like them because they give me direct access to South America without South American FX risk.
* DQJCY, MTNOY: Riskier positions with high growth potential. MTNOY gives me exposure to frontier markets in Africa, where they have 20% of the African telecoms market share; and a growing fintech and payment processing business. Meanwhile DQJCY gives me exposure to the growing discount retail market, especially in emerging economies hit hard by COVID. DQJCY - who operates Don Don Donki, Don Quijote, Gelson‚Äôs, and other stores - is the 2nd largest discount department store company in the world, behind Target; and one of the world‚Äôs top 50 fastest growing retailers (#18).

*Currency exposures of my stock investments: AUD, CAD, EUR, JPY, NOK, USD, ZAR*

453,"The root cause of why you are worried is because I'm assuming you haven't bothered digging into MSFT's financials, which is surprising considering you own it.

The most basic info. you should look up for any company is:

1. What is their EPS?

2. What growth rate did they achieve over the past 5 years, and what is a conservative growth rate over the next 5?

It's EXTREMELY simplified but at least it will help you understand their risk level.

First one let's you find out how much you're paying per dollar they're making and second one puts it in context. There's a ratio called PEG ratio that tries to put it into one number.

For further context you'd then work out how much you have to pay for companies/competitors in the same industry, what their growth rates are, then look at the broader market to see what you'd have to pay for that.

If you don't do the above, well here's an analogy:

You're basically asking is a property worth $323k if it was $50k in 2016. People will ask follow up questions: which location? how big is it? what condition? what are similar houses in the area going for? 

It could be a booming area where all properties went from 50k to 323k, and is likely to keep going up.

To answer your question, I also hold MSFT but it's 38PE which is higher than I like to see. The market is more expensive but I can get GOOG and AAPL for less than 30PE. While I expect MSFT growth rate to be higher than AAPL, I think GOOG has as big of a moat and growth rates in line with MSFT so if I were buying today, I'd weigh more into GOOG",2021-12-05 03:59:44,2021-12-05,0.9705

My estimate is that the market is still a few percentage over valued now that we're pricing in 5 rate hikes instead of 4, but normally the market will overshoot. I think we could go down another 5% on the S&amp;P500 and any high beta stocks you own like tech could get hit harder.

That said, a few percentage points is easily within the margin of error so who knows... I was worried AAPL/MSFT earnings would be the catalyst lower, but we're past that now. I don't know if you were investing back in 2018, but rate hikes and shrinking the balance sheet sent the S&amp;P500 down like 20%. Back then multiples were lower too. So far this has been reasonably orderly with the exception of the panic in growth stocks.

I suspect strong growth expectations and decent earnings are the only thing holding the market up right now and if that changes over the next couple of months we'll need to go lower for valuations to make sense.",2022-01-28 02:41:44,2022-01-28,0.3551

This will unlikely happen. If it happens that will lead to recessionary phase.

True, no one can predict perfectly, but we can guesstimate the bottom. If the estimate is correct, we win. Otherwise, we lose the money we invest.

Few things in favor. MSFT, AAPL, VISA, TSLA and few others results are better and they bottomed and turning upside (i.e. investors are buying). NFLX is up by Bill Ackman 1.1Bln purchase (he just bottom fished)

GEX is going up side, once it is 4+bln, we are safe to call bottom crossed. DIX jumped 37.4 to 51.2 (i.e. dark pool big investors bought call options that resulted big jump =&gt; [https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix))

I dont know if they will or not, thats the point. Look at sears, ge, gpro, grpn,bbry and many others that at the time of their downfall, someone like you said the exact same thing you are saying now. Are these companies different? in hindsight sure. At the time, not so much.

All I know is, today, the market is willing to pay 20-30x sales on companies that have no buy back plan or dividends. 20-30 years from now, people might not. 

The returns that these companies have had has been in share price due to people buying shares.  Aapl and msft issue dividends and do engage in buy backs, this is the return you should be looking at, since it is what keeps people holding shares and produces real value for holders.

If a company is just growing in share price but has limited earnings, the hope is at some point theyll return earnings to the holders, but this may never happen. If it isnt happening, then your only out is someone who is willing to pay more than you did.

Like Netflix they had a multi year headstart as the leader in their sector, but now like Netflix, they are facing competition from all sides. 

TSLA also just received a sell rating and a hold rating from two major firms, and the CNBC Pro section which I can't read because I don't subscribe has a headline saying that Tesla generates a lot of cash but has experts baffled about its nearterm future moves.  This includes btw deciding not to come out with any new products for all of 2022 at least.

Musk knows he has a large cult of followers who hang on his every word and will continue to throw money at him. Because he gotten so stinking rich so fast he seems to believe that just saying and doing whatever he wants got him rich so he should continue, even if his tweets become mpre and more childish and counter-productive.  I would avoid this stock for those reasons.  Buy AAPL, MSFT or some of the discount value names. They are also cash machines but they have responsible leadership and low or reasonable valuations.

Yea this is incredibly off-putting and shortsighted. Possibly stupidest post of the day. Maybe the week. Honestly maybe the month.

Nobody wants to be in a bear market. Not even bears. This is an actual fact. Its
ramifications stretch beyond whether or not you (the stock picking boy wonder) find the next AAPL at its low (hint: you will not and even if you did you'd sell it for a loss because you're a dumbshit in the middle of a bear market). A bear market represents a slowing, faltering, contracting, or broken economy. You know, like during the Great Depression and Great Recession (some of its greatest hits).

I find it hilarious that you think it's some sort of opportunity to ""get back in"" after you failed completely to recognize and get in on the greatest bull run in history. Yet somehow during a bear market (something which you have zero understanding of) you will get it right.

Son, you won't even find a job if we go bear market. The tech startup with the blue haired receptionist that you want to intern for and ultimately join won't exist. All your favorite Wendy's? Closed for good.

In fact the stock has already tripled n value from its fair value range.  At even a 40 PE the stock should be at no more than $400.  And there is no way it should have three times the market cap of Toyota or one third that of AAPL.

What Tesla makes in one year is what Apple makes in three weeks. and Apple has double the profit margins plus much more loyal customers.  Tesla has very few customers who will never switch to another brand.  Upscale car buyers are notoriously fickle and always showing off the next new brand.  Plus Tesla has tremendous competition now that they didn't have 3 years ago.

Furthermore, Musk is an unstable genius and not a professional CEO.  Plus he is a major insider seller, the biggest in the world.   He does not care aboujt shareholders and does not take responsibility for his words or actions His challenge to McDonalds was childish, amongst many childish things he has tweeted.

158,"They don‚Äôt buy corporate bonds, they government treasurer bonds and mortgage back securities. 

So if the US government needs to raise funds which like every week. It goes to open market and sells to 19 preset buyers such as Bank of America, JPm and so on.  These funds are buying on their clients‚Äô behalf such as our 401k, other governments, other corporations such as aapl and so on. These entities look to get higher interest rates and hence the interest rates go up and down.  



When fed buy these treasures bonds  means that the US treasury directly sells to fed and the treasury does not need to go to the open market and hence fed is lending money at pre set rates.  I today‚Äôs case 0%.  

Since the entities looking buy these funds no longer can get interest rate they desire they find alternative ways to earn yields such as investing in stocks or corporate bonds or real assets such as housing or mortgages and so on. 

This stimulates economy as these entities are Peking their money at the treasury.  


Now some of these entities lend their funds to me and you to buy homes.  Since their risk on these bonds is essentially 0 because fed is also buying MBS from these entities via fennie Mae and so on   These entities borrow from fed the money at 0% then write us a check for the mortgages and then take that mortgage and sell it back to fed via mbs at a preset interest rates.   So if we get rate at say 3.5% and fed buys at say 1.0% the banks now make the 2.5%.  

The reason this is a risk feee trade for banks is that they have already sold risky mbs to fed and kept only the mortgages from highly rated fico score folks.  

This is why we should see some of the banks who write buy and hold mbs benefit more. Such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo.  

Not all banks keep these mortgages they resell them to boA jpm wfc and so on. So not all bans be for from higher mortgages.

Firstly their current TTM revenue is $1b, not $600m and they don't need to x20 sales to reach a reasonable valuation. That would put them at a PS of 6. Not even AAPL trades at that. A more reasonable long-term PS for a high margin company is probably 10-15 so they would need to x5 sales. Lets say over the next decade SNOWs average annual growth rate will be 40% -- this is extremely conservative imo. Then at the end of the decade they would have x28 sales giving them around $28b in annual rev. Even if you then give them a low future PS of 10 that would still equate to a $280B market cap or 3.5x your investment in 10 years. If you give them a 15 PS, you'll be looking at a 5x return.

It's rather obvious that revenue is not an appropriate metric to measure the a company's profitability, but maybe that had to be stated in my original piece. Revenue was used because this piece is about consumer spending on Apple products which can really only be measured by looking at Revenue.

Agree that services are seeing strong growth AND increasing profit margins which is a very promising thing to see. This is why long-term I am bullish on AAPL.

Businesses can't exactly decide to stop paying for servers in a recession, but they will stop buying pricey phones and laptops.

I think it just depends on what you're investing in and your time horizon to be honest... It's not like the long-term growth trend of cybersecurity is going to impacted much by an economic slowdown, but the pandemic growth we saw in home fitness was obviously going to be a temporary trend.

You can't explain this with interest rate hikes alone in my opinion, so assuming it's not irrational fear, it's most likely related to post-pandemic slowdown concerns.

It's possible SHOP has just been overvalued for years and AAPL was undervalued for years... And admittedly a good argument could be made there. But this divergence in valuation is interesting. It suggests that either historical valuations were mispriced, or that current valuations are.

Tesla is a smallish company compared to AAPL and MSFT and if it growing faster than either is anyone's guess, but if so it isn't by much. Let's say it is growing faster, maybe 30% max.  It has a PE in the hundreds, 300-100 and nothing in its projections even comes close to meriting a 100 PE or even a 50 PE. Plus is has lower profit margins much lower than AAPL, and much less loyal customers than AAPL.

Like Amazon, Tesla might dominate in some upscale markets but will likely never thrive anywhere but the progressive affluent areas of the first world and China and the new competition for Tesla is just as heavy as it is for Netflix now.  In fact at the end of the day TSLA might merit the same market cap as Toyota but it doesn't yet. 

PLus we are now in a tech market that is bringing down multiples not adding to them.  If a company has a 30 PE it needs to grow that much or close to it.   And if it has a PE in the hundreds well that is an impossible task unless it's a comp tp the covid shutdown quarter.   MSFT just posted 18% growth its 32 PE and got taken down 5%. AAPl had better show at least 22% growth or they too will go down 5%. So why does TSLA get treated special?

Sorry, but just because Musk has special talents doesn't mean his stock gets a free ride, especially after his massive insider selling and flakey moves like saying he will accept Dogecoin, a known scam which was created as a joke.

228,"In the short-term the economy is mostly irrelevant. It doesn't really matter how good companies are fundamentally if the FED is going to hike aggressively which seems to be becoming consensus. Aggressive FED hiking + economic slowdown can take the market down much further. You need to keep in mind that even after all this selling the S&amp;P500 still doesn't seem cheap. When sentiment turns this negative you generally need stocks to start looking relatively attractive from a valuation perspective to get investors to look passed their concerns.

What worries me is that when I look at a company like AAPL I see a stock that could quite easily half if it misses earnings in 2022 in tandem to FED rate hikes. I'm not invested in AAPL but given it's weighting that should worry anyone in the market generally right now. A lot of tech is in a similar position too... A stock like NVDA is trading at a 2-3x higher valuation than it was just a few years ago... While I think fundamentally the overall market is fine, and that you could argue that stocks like AAPL or NVDA are worth their high valuations, when market sentiment is this negative it's probably not going to be enough for the market to just look reasonably valued.

Back in 2018 when the FED announced rate hikes would be on autopilot the market panicked and the S&amp;P500 dropped down to a very attractive valuation of about 19 PE. Today, even after all the selling this last month, we're trading at a 24.5 PE. So if this ends up like 2018 a 25% drop just on the S&amp;P500 is potentially on the table, and that's assuming earnings hold up... The market needs some narrative to justify valuations, whether that's strong earnings or a dovish FED. Until we get one of those, I don't see how this ends.

I think the only thing that's going to give the market confidence to go higher at this point is the FED reassuring the markets or strong tech earnings. If either are bad - or perhaps even just neutral - I think we go lower.

If AAPL falls along aside a FED that remains hawkish on tackling inflation markets going 10-20% lower from here would not be out of the question.

Then on top of that you have ongoing geopolitical risks and pandemic risks... The risk/reward of equities right now is more skewed towards risk than it's been in a while.

Some notable events that triggered my curiosity to think about investing

* Read Rich Dad Poor Dad book in 2002ish - understood the concept of assets and liabilities and the idea of making money work for you.

* Watched the stock market boom in 2004 and understood that there's something in there.

* Saw a long term stock market chart going up when an insurance sales man tried to sell me insurance. That chart never got out of my mind.


Got my first job early in 2005 after graduating in 2004 with no student debt. Initial pay was zero (was really an apprentice) but started getting a stipend in 3 months and they made me full time after five months.

Started putting money aside and investing monthly from every paycheck into mutual funds.

Started writing a blog in 2005 and within a few months, was making more money through revenue share than my regular job. So was making a good money for a single low-expense single guy.

Kept topping up my investments as I had excess cash.

Convinced my brother to contribute regularly into the stock market like I did. He started in 2005 but later cashed out in 2008 when the market started acting up and he needed cash for his wedding. He would have been a multimillionaire if he stayed the course. Tried to convince my parents but they didn't grow up knowing anything about investing and thought putting money in the stock market was ""gambling"" and this was a taboo in our family circles.

Was single. Didn't waste money on silly girls and parties. Had fun though. Was focussed on my career. Was a descent saver. Lived on rent by sharing an apartment. 

Came to the US in 2007 through my employer's sponsorship. So started contributing my investments to US markets.

Wasn't really perturbed by 2008 crisis as I was young, travelling due to work and didn't really know the mechanics of the economy and what the big deal was. Was mainly focusing on my career and my paycheck. Was clueless about the economic crisis and personally felt my job was secure even though I worked at a major asset management firm in 2006 to 2007 and one of the big four banks during the time from 2008 to 2009 that was laying off folks. I kept topping up if I had excess cash. Didn't really look at price due to my ignorance. Was right next to Lehman since 2007 at time square. Was wondering why coworkers were making a big deal with Bearstearns going bust and then Fannie and Freddie.

I got a bit savy with personal finance after reading a bit, watchign documentaries etc - so no debts, no credit card debt etc. Started learning more about the economy. I started churning credit cards to pile up points and miles as I learned you could save on flights through airline miles. Since 2010, I never paid for a flight ticket and have made around 75K worth of flights through accumulating points and miles with my family and extended family. Tried to get all the bank sign up cash bonuses I could during those times. I've now stopped that as we have sticky relationships with the banks where we have accounts. 

By 2010 I started looking at individual stocks. Slowly started buying individual stocks by cashing out mutual funds - bought stocks like DIS, AAPL, DLR, TGT, WMT, MCD, SBUX, COST, V, etc.... still hold these positions. Have had other positions have sold, bought, sold at various times over the years but reduced major selling since 2016. I only sell for rare reasons. 

Got married in 2011. She didn't make much... just had a stipend as she was still studying. But she was not a spend thrift, was clueless about investing and some $115K in student debt. Her retirement account was all cash. I changed the allocation and started maxing it out. I pretty much took over the finances. We were good at sticking with a budget, regularly saving, investing, no high debt, used tools like Mint to track finances, budget and set goals. Later in 2013, I started using personal capital and added that to the toolset. Kept paying slightly more in student debt so it would reduce principal.

My wife finished her studies in 2016 and got a real job in late 2016 and started making 4x of what I was making. Prior to that, I was making 2x of what she was making. We paid off all the student debt, bought a house with 20% cash saved up over the years for a downpayment. Had always kept around 90% of financial assets in stocks.

Reaching the million dollar mark in 2018.

Right now have a low to mid 7 figure portfolio with 95% of networth in financial assets. 5% in cash. 

I've taken advantage of every tax advantaged vehicle I can think of since I got married .... IRA &amp; Roth IRA (while it fell under income limits) Texas ORP, 403B, 401Ks, DCPs, 457s, 529s, DAF etc. Been filing my own taxes using software since 2007.",2022-01-24 16:05:59,2022-01-24,0.9907

316,"Let's be reasonable. The market has been uber expensive since last year with many major companies trading in ridiculously high PE ratio (I am looking at you Tesla, maybe Apple, Amazon, Disney). Stocks have been rallying to the moon since the ""flash crash"" in March 2020, particularly because of the government's generous money printing policies that puts the market in steroid overdose. Many stocks have been fell from grace (aka the peak) from their all-time highs, including large companies like PENN, PYPL, EBAY, COIN, and LULU just to name a few (if you exclude meme stocks like AMC and China stocks like BABA). But, for some reason the indices keep going up? That's because a few large-cap companies like AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, and TSLA are propping it up. If people start taking profits, it will collapse to the ground in no time. They are WAY overvalued in proportion to their accomplishments.

Yes, I sold everything except what's in my retirement because, again, the market is WAY overvalued. I have been progressively holding more and more cash since October. Do you honestly think without the generous money printing, Dow Jones would reach 45,000 and S&amp;P would reach 5,000 by the end of this year? In this pace, S&amp;P would reach 10,000 in 5 years! Please! Money has to come from somewhere!

If you have primarily index funds and maybe ""safe"" companies like WMT and BRK.B, you will be fine as long as you have patience for the next who know how many years. If your portfolio is tech-heavy or are filled with stuff like TSLA or even meme stocks, it's time to rethink your strategy because you should have had an exit plan at the beginning. The party has to end sometime.

Below are my asset allocations based on everything I own.  Am I too aggressive for a 35 year old male, no kids, no debt?  What would you do next? I guess I‚Äôm also feeling a bit lost about what I can do.  

I would like to reduce my total % of individual stocks, but I also have some names that have fallen a lot I really like. The majority of the ETFs are VOO or VTI, but I do have some leanings toward real estate, semiconductors, and fintech.  No single position is more than 6% of portfolio (apple 5.5%, msft 3%). I feel I‚Äôm well diversified except I only have bonds through RPAR and it‚Äôs not much. 

The numbers; 

Total Assets $164,639.45

Cash ‚Äì $27,943.00 / 16.97%

-split between an emergency fund and 15k in brokerage. 

Individual Stocks - $18,752.12 / 11.39%

-AMAT, TSM, MU, PYPL, MSFT, OKE, F, SPG, TD, WFC, NIO, SQ, JNJ, BRK.B, AMKR, FB, TWTR, APPH, AAPL, MP, BABA, PLTR. 
-(Biggest position is apple and PayPal)

ETFS/Funds ‚Äì $112,614.32 / 68.40%

-($6k of this is RPAR, a mix of treasuries, TIPS, gold, commodities, energy, and VT)

Crypto - $5,200 / 3.16%

-Btc, eth, link, uniswap (65/30/2.5/2.5%)

Leveraged ETF - $130 / .08%

- $130 in SOXL

Debts - $200 on credit card

-payoff biweekly 

Monthly Income after Taxes $5,091

Monthly Expenses         

401k  $1200

Rent $950

Bills $450

Usually between 2400-2500 left over on a monthly basis most goes into vanguard.

318,"No offense, but I groan every time I hear this type of comment. ""Good companies will be fine."" It demonstrates a lack of understanding of investing and the discussion. Take AAPL for example. Nobody is going to argue that the company will not be fine. That's not even the discussion. In 5 years, AAPL will still be selling iPhones, tablets, watches and various other stuff I don't personally want.

But what many will argue is that your **investment in that company** will probably not be fine, because its valuation is bloated beyond all recognition. This is what some of you don't seem to get. When you pay a 30x earnings multiple for a great company, that typically trades at 15x, and there doesn't seem to be much reason for the multiple to have doubled. We are not concerned for the company. It's your investment that seems foolish. And you'll probably lose money on.",2022-01-23 23:48:40,2022-01-23,-0.7175

Bought and held through March 2020, into 2021.  Every dip was made for buying and as long as you didn't hold garbage companies you did well.  Stuff like TSLA, GOOGL, AAPL.  But even the small caps weren't horrible choices. Even COIN and DOCU while hyped aren't BAD companies.  I myself am in stocks like PLTR, TTCF, CRSR. Among others. NIO etc.  Not aweful companies just getting recked for months.  We all though that after the profit/loss taking in Jan there'd be a ralley. A lot of people went in on margin. You can literally look at the debt and leverage ratios.  

In Nov. Dec. And early Jan we had the 2020 2021 just hold and you'll be fine. Buy the dip and you'll be fine.  

But now the dip won't stop I bet Kevin lost a couple mil each month for the last 3 months. Wouldn't be surprised if he's down 10mil plus since Nov 4. AND he had margin. 

I was in the same boat. Lost 2/3s of my port since Nov. And have margin to pay off. Maybe we rebound maybe not. But at this point if I don't pay the margin then I might not have the assets to back it up.  

I don't agree that he flipped and mislead his viewers. But at the same time they need to do their own research. 

I'll also say this is a huge sign of getting close to the floor. I don't like that small caps and crpt are wrecked and mega Caps and SP are still near all time highs.  I don't like that NFLX tanked 25% after a beat plus bad guidance. 

I do think it's a good idea to be out of margin, out of debt and DCA through the bottom and on the way back up. Period.

I don't think selling it all and going short NOW is the best option

9,"I have some atypical advise.  

I would suggest not DCAing into VTI right now, since the slight adds at the current price will likely not affect your cost basis much (since it sounds like you went in heavy and are only able to add a slight amount right now relative to that).

Instead, I would open a position in VOO (or VT) and maybe QQQ, and start DCAing in at these better prices.   

This will accomplish two things:

1) Psychologically, you‚Äôll be back in the green much sooner and will also see that cost basis and feel better.  

2) Liquidity wise, you‚Äôll be able to sell the VOO/VT/QQQ positions much sooner for either a profit or less of a loss, should you want access to the money.  


Once the rebound starts, just switch your DCAing into VTI and let your profit margin grow on VOO/VT/QQQ, which will be satisfying.  If you ever wished to simplify your portfolio, then you could take profit off VOO/VT/QQQ and put it into VTI.  

The psychological component shouldn‚Äôt be underestimated.  Following this plan also has practical benefits.  The advice to just crawl into a hole and pretend this isn‚Äôt happening is not useful.

BABA is a hard one.  Xi is not his predecessor.  I‚Äôd recommend making a logical decision on it, and then either selling now and taking the loss, or committing to average down aggressively there at the sub $90/share price.  I think it needs to be one or the other, based on your own analysis and time frame and perspective.  

On NVDA, you could offset that risk by opening positions in MU and INTC at the more attractive current prices.  

I don‚Äôt know anything about Redfin...looked at it and seems to have good sales but no profit yet (potentially reinvesting?) and a TINY market cap.    At such a small market cap, if this is something you believe in long term, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about your present coat basis much.  What is Redfin?  Look at related companies and their market cap to get an idea of where it might go once mature or whatever your thesis plays out.

Investing rewards the singles hitters. Long term you don‚Äôt need to chase home runs. Unless you‚Äôre an excellent stock picker - just buy companies that make a lot of money. When you look back at your portfolio - you‚Äôll be handsomely rewarded in 20+ years time.

HD isn‚Äôt sexy - but it makes money. MCD isn‚Äôt sexy - but it makes money. TGT isn‚Äôt sexy - but it makes money. AAPL is kind of sexy AND it makes money.

I like AMZN. They have so many great products... Ecommerce, cloud, streaming, etc... I don't really understand why it's struggled so much the last few years. I think investors might be a little worried about what the change in CEO means for AMZN's future. I know people love to hate on Bezos but the dude build AMZN from the ground up and has continuously expanded the business into new areas for years. I worry that same drive for endless grow might not be there anymore, but even if it's not I don't think it's reason to be bearish. If AMZN just continues to dominate in ecommerce and cloud they'll do fine. AAPL underperformed when Tim Cook took over too, it took the market some time to feel sure the company was in good hands. Arguably you could point to MSFT and Ballmer as a reason to be a little cautious when a founder steps down as CEO.

Who knows what's going to happen short-term, but they've got years of strong growth ahead of them with AWS (a product now CEO, Andy Jassy created alongside Bezos) and the stock is currently trading at it's lowest valuation in years. If there is a recession coming they'll be able to weather it and if the economy picks back up later this year the stock should start to recover along with it.

64,"Man you‚Äôre kinda not smart.

Let me explain. First, $BABA is not a holding company at all. They have no true assets, just an agreement contract. Whereas An ETF has direct ownership of the underlying shares held by their custodian. So you, the owner on record of that ETF, owns the underlying shares held with the custodian. An ETF is just the ownership claim that is tradeable on the market.

When you buy $BABA. You buy an ADR, a form of receipt for a cayman island company called Alibaba. This company has a contract (KEYWORD CONTRACT) with mainland Alibaba to share in the profits. You do not have direct ownership to/or claims to mainland Alibaba (true Alibaba). This is different from you owning $AAPL. You have a US court system enforcing that claim of equity ownership.

This is why the ADR, of a company with a VIE agreement with mainland Alibaba can go to $0. Ie $BABA. Because of claimant issues and non direct ownership, this is the reason why this ‚Äústock‚Äù is so cheap.

Because if China decides to fuck around and get sanctioned. They retaliate by invalidating all VIE contracts and ‚Äúpoof‚Äù goes your $BABA value and that ‚Äúprofit sharing‚Äù VIE agreement between the two entities (cayman island BABA and real mainland BABA). And everyone takes an L.

Sort of like how some American companies taking an L in Russia, because their claim to assets in Russia just went ‚Äúpoof‚Äù.",2022-03-10 23:43:17,2022-03-10,0.9666
65,"I was thinking about NIO and BABA when I started reading the title. It really depends on the business. A growth stage business has a lot of areas they can invest money back into the business. NIO is a good example of this. Instead of doing a buy back, they could just invest another billion $ into something like a new model or more battery swap stations. However, NIO's CEO has actually made comments that he thinks the SP is extremely low, and they do have a lot of cash, so they could do a buyback (although odds are low). With larger companies, like AAPL for example, it really depends on the companies leadership. AAPL does buy backs more than most because they are very conservative. Apple generally likes to take it's time and really investigate potential business ventures before jumping into anything. Their mantra is ""you don't have to be first if you're the best"". So the best thing they can do with their sidelined cash is to buyback their own shares and then if they ever need to raise money, they will sell those shares. To me BABA is somewhere in between. I don't see BABA management as particularly conservative, but they're also not a small company anymore so buybacks are a possibility.",2022-03-10 21:16:23,2022-03-10,0.8845

67,"This is a commonly iterated trope by the ETF fans and it's so misleading. Professional money managers typically underperform the market, yes, but that has nothing to do with retail investors. It's really fairly easy for the average investor to outperform. 

Professional managers 1) deal with sums of money in the hundreds of millions to billions. They can't be as nimble as the average retail investor working with a few hundred thousand. Large funds can't swoop in and buy undervalued small and mid cap stock without making major waves in the market. And 2) professional money managers have an obligation to hit specific diversification levels and not exceed certain risk. There are more than enough studies showing that any random set of 25 diversified stocks perform in line with broad market. Add in management fees, and yes, they underperform.

The average investor doesn't have these limitations. They can invest across a broad array of cap sizes, weight their portfolio how they wish, and hold a concentrated set of assets to outperform. If all you did was hold GOOG, AAPL, FB, and MSFT, hardly what anyone would call ""risky"" stock you'd outperform the market by 14% per year. Professional funds can't do that.

Not to say that the average retail investor is smart enough to do any of this. Judging by the past two years, they love to chase stocks with shoddy performance, just because they're hot names.

123,"&gt; People will buy Apple devices no matter what.

In every recession people spend less on high-end consumer electronics and companies with cheaper products tend do slightly better. I agree people will still want to buy Apple devices, but the reality is a lot of people simply won't be able to afford it in a recession. I mean this is kind of obvious unless you're from a privileged background.

It's not just consumer demand though, Apple sells a lot of devices to businesses and businesses will be much less likely to refresh their devices during a recession. This is even more true in 2022/2023 given so many businesses brought new devices for their employees to work from home during the pandemic.

To be clear not saying AAPL is a bad investment. I'm just saying it has a lot of room to fall if there was a recession. You might remember that in 2018 it fell 35% just because the FED put balance sheet reductions on autopilot and investors started to get a bit worried about a recession. AAPL's relative strength during this selloff has been quite unusual, but I suspect that will change as recession fears increase.",2022-03-08 13:44:52,2022-03-08,-0.9139

125,"Apple sells high-end consumer devices lol. You think people are still going to be buying a new iPhones and Macbooks when they're paying $4 a gallon for gas and they've just lost their job because of a recession?

Apple has a strong balance sheet but in a recession they would still struggle. MSFT is probably a bit safer, but still has room to fall. Obviously this assumes a recession is coming, but right now stocks like AAPL are not pricing in the increased risk of a recession and if recession continues to look more likely AAPL could fall 20-30% quite easily.

At the same time a lot of the market is down 30%+ and I'd argue many stocks are trading at recessionary level discounts at this point. They could obviously fall further but when you look at a FB trading at a PE 13 it's hard to imagine them falling that much more even if they were to post disappoint earnings.

I'm getting more constructive on the market, but I think the bottom is going to be marked by a 4-5% single day drop in AAPL. At the moment most investors are just rotating into safety and not fleeing the market entirely. I suspect this is why valuations of stocks like AAPL remain elevated despite increasing signs of recession and consumer weakness. When we start to see broad panic and universal selling of stocks I think we can say with more certainty a bottom may have been reached. We're starting to see this a bit, but stocks like AAPL are probably still acting a little too defensively. It's still a ways out yet, but if AAPL posts disappointing earnings in April it's going to be a bloodbath.",2022-03-08 12:35:31,2022-03-08,-0.9768

128,"AWS is the dominant cloud player and growing rapidly. Yes they have competition, but cloud is a growing sector and there's enough room for competition. As someone who works in tech I don't see MSFT passing their market share anytime soon and even if they did it wouldn't necessarily be too concerning so long as AWS's growth remained strong.

Higher wages and fuel costs impacts AMZN more than some of the other tech companies, but I worry about the other big tech players for other reasons. If there's a recession AAPLs earnings will drop significantly as people and business will be less likely to spend on high-end devices. Yes, AAPL has the money to weather the storm, but it will be a rough period for them. Another thing I worry about were there a recession is ad spend. Ad spend would also drop significantly in a recession and this would hurt FB and GOOG. Relatively speaking I think MSFT and AMZN are a bit more defensive at a time like this because cloud infrastructure spending is less likely to be cut.

You're right that AMZN has a slightly higher PE than other big tech names, but I would note it has a lower EV/EBITDA ratio than MSFT and at 21, it's roughly inline with what other big tech names are trading at. Relatively speaking many of the big tech names (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG) are trading at their highest valuations for many years while AMZN is trading at it's lowest in many years. FB is the only big tech name that looks more attractive from a valuation perspective, but it's also the lowest quality big tech name in my opinion.

I'm just comparing relative risks and valuations of big tech names here. It's possible all of big tech is overvalued, but if I was going to buy a big tech name right now it would probably be AMZN. That said, I don't think you can really go wrong with owning AMZN, MSFT, GOOG or AAPL long-term. Near-term all of tech like much of the market is going to continue to struggle. If you're asking for a bull case for AMZN over the next 6 months I would agree it's hard to see, but over the next 2-3 years a strong bull case is there and this is probably one of the best times to buy AMZN in years.",2022-03-08 10:59:40,2022-03-08,-0.812

For food industries to discontinue is just plane stupid. Don't hold McD or KO but if I did I'd be pissed if they stopped supplying to Russia. It's a complete slap on the face for shareholders.

I hold NVDA not too pissed since there's is a chip shortage anyway and I don't see sales affected too much from their cease of supply to Russia. The supply prob just get redistributed to other countries since demand is high everywhere. Can't say the same with McD or KO.

You bought really heavy on tech. So did I. My losses look like yours. Going forward, I'd recommend re-evaluating *why* you choose a stock. Pick something because you feel it will either work for you in the long run, or because you feel it's undervalued. My best undervalued pick was F at 12, and I ditched it at 15. 25% is huge, but I only put 10% of a small capital into buying undervalued. My biggest long term has been AAPL at $112, and I put 90% of my investment capital into long term investments.

Take it slow. If you make this a race, you'll lose. Don't take your stock advice from Reddit because we're all amateurs and you have no way of knowing if we're telling the truth. If you can't pick a company, pick a concept and buy an ETF. Sometimes those do poorly too *cough*TAN*cough* but the drops are a lot slower.

Here is why - with the billions of dollars in free cash flow FB executive team has and the userbase to boot they are simply too big to fail. Even if Apple could somehow reduce their entire revenue stream by 80% in some short term deboggle, people with those apps installed will inherently still be giving some data to FB. Many people use social media apps across multiple devices - what if 10 years into user A they log in one time on a device that doesnt have those preventions in place?

290,"AAPL buybacks alone will be worth 3-4% a year increase. They may not grow as fast as GOOG but we don‚Äôt know what new products they have in store. Why I remain bullish is due to the fact that all the teenagers have or want an iPhone. Horace Deidu tweeted that we spend an average of 4 hrs a day on our phones. That number will increase as our analog world starts to blur the line with the digital world. Plus iPhones and Macs still have a minority share in the world. 

Also, the M1 has been a huge success. When they announced they were designing their own computer chips based on the A1 nearly everyone laughed it off. I thought that it was brilliant because how efficient A1 was. I bought a base MacBook Air over a year ago and it replaced 3 of my computers. Now they are designing their own cell phone chip and everyone is saying good luck. What if they pull it off and create a super efficient Arm chip with integrated modem? 

I think AAPL is a super safe stock that will grow steady. As a shareholder since the original iPhone release, naysayers have been saying the same things over and over again.

I don't think ""buffet premium"" acctually exists nowadays, and I expect no lasting effect on share price after they are no more in charge.

337,"AAPL/MSFT. TGT/WMT. QQQ or SCHD (depending on your risk tolerance I suppose). HD/LOW.

Logic: AAPL/MSFT - leaders in technology areas, deep pocket books, massive cash flows to continue R&amp;D, etc

TGT/WMT - brick and mortar super retailers who will outlast everyone else. There will always be a need for brick and mortar - and these two, as general retailers, are killing it. Plus they both pay a respectable dividend (between 1.5 and 2% yield)

QQQ or SCHD - QQQ more growth focused - SCHD steady payouts. SCHD more for risk adverse.

HD/LOW - what they do cannot be replaced online retail. They have insane balance sheets, pay a steady dividend (1.5-2.5% yield), and they are irreplaceable. As long as there are homes people own or are being built - these two will continue to print money and provide steady growth (and dividend payments) over the next 15+ years.

Sorry - didn‚Äôt read all the rules. International I‚Äôd stick with a stable dividend play - like a GSK, ROG.

The stock market in the short term is a voting machine, but in the long term it is a weighing machine.

If it does fall for prolonged period, then most likely the issue is not the war, its something else and the war is just the trigger that exposes the weakness.

For many parts of the market, we're in month 5 of a bear market / correction. I'm buying companies that I think will continue to have strong cash flows, even with inflation head winds, which is how I have such a small list of stocks.

Timing the bottom is just as difficult to time as the top, so the only thing I'm considering right now is if the price will be higher next February. For good companies with consistent and growing cash flows, the answer will very likely be 'yes'. 

It's now more important to understand the value of what you're holding. I could have been tempted to jump out of my OSTK leaps while the price just went from $50, down to $38, but earnings came out stellar and the price went right back up to the $40s. One year price target on this stock is over $100, and it has a P/E of like 5. So I don't care about the price action this month, because I think by September my LEAPS are going to be printing hard.

I think there are a lot of scary macro economic numbers out there, but people calling for crashes are just wishful thinking. They won't have a chance to buy AMZN or GOOG at $1000. AAPL isn't going down to $60. I'm not even sure TSLA will get back down to $600. It's not a question of multiples; the cash flows justify their current valuations, even under conservative multiples and projections.

I think very speculative stocks can and will continue to get crushed, but there are many companies out there that are surprisingly good deals right now after months of selling off, while pulling in great profits. Saying ""historically, S&amp;P should be at 13 P/E"" is completely meaningless. That data comes from a time of slower growth rates and fewer globally scaled mega-corporations. Saying the dollar is devalued by printing and M2 is also kind of meaningless if every other country in the world does the same thing.

415,"I'm not bearish in the sense that I think we're about to enter a massive recession, but I am nervous about the strength of the economy going forward. I think a minor recession is absolutely on the cards and I see no reason to be bullish right now.

It appears we're seeing a broad rerating of valuations which is something that hasn't happened since 2018. In 2018 we had a large selloff followed by a rapid recovery thanks to the FED's u-turn. This time the u-turn isn't happening so my guess is that the market PE multiple will drop to around 18-20 and it will remain at those levels going forward. There will be no recovery this time and we'll just have to wait for earnings to push the market higher. I also think it's quite likely we don't see new highs this year. PE's have been elevated since 2019 in my opinion because investors felt confidence that there would be a FED put to save them whenever markets sold off. Without that I think we have to revert back to pre-2018 valuations.

I suspect we have another 10-20% to go on the S&amp;P500 and I don't think we've seen the worst of the selling yet, but I could be wrong. I'd look for a bottom when AAPL falls 4-5% in a day and everyone is convinced there will be a recession. I'm not seeing people flee from safety yet and most people still seem to be broadly constructive on markets which wouldn't typically suggest a bottom.

417,"Having used/developed my own algo for stock trading last 5 years, here I share my experience. I may be  right/wrong as I have not gone to the depth in this field.

First thing, I have tested appx 20-25 ML open source packages, initially when I started, nothing worked. Started my own algo, finally settled one.

Second, there are plenty of companies selling algos, may make better decision than human manual calculations. Instead of calculating manually through excel they help us to take decision fast.

Most of the algos I have noticed are technical side, short term outlook, uses some gap/loophole in the system.

With the advent of computerization, big data analysis, we will see more and more coming up daily basis.

It is really hard for retailers/companies to compete the algos that is inevitable. However, to my knowledge, they are short term focus, esp technical ones.

Even my case, I do use Short term algo, that helps me in the long run better than using an excel sheet.

If you do find good companies at cheaper price, esp after working a good fundamental model, there are bright chances for buy/holder win the race.

The key is to know the company fundamentals in depth, know DCF analysis, buy at low, hold forever. I have seen two of friends keep buying AAPL since 1998, and TSLA since IPO, never sold the stocks.

They have the means to make a big acquisition or buffer through just about any downturn.

I have other positions to take more advantage of opportunity but for me my risk exposure is of high concern so I only like to use a smaller portion of my portfolio to try and capture those richer opportunities.

433,"PLTR is going through an S curve. Slow adoption and growth at first (government contracts only) and are now breaking into commercial sector (NATO alliance only).

The share based comp dilutes the share price but it‚Äôs pretty interesting seeing the misunderstanding people have. The float has gone up because the company is using its stock as a currency to pay out for talent. 

The company has actually had minimal share issuance since their direct listing, as a matter of fact, even the SBC is slowing down year over year. 

The company is 424M positive free cash flow, no debt, and has a stable foundational client with government contracts. So if you think the shares will go to $0, then perhaps you dont understand what holding equity truly means. There‚Äôs almost zero chance of bankruptcy risk where debt holders wipe equity holders and the company is taken over by debt holders. Because there‚Äôs no debt‚Ä¶ 

So depending on one‚Äôs stomach for volatility, you can buy and own a unique company that has the track record for execution, at the highest and national security levels of demanding.

This is a long hold and see how they grow their commercial side of the business. The nearest competitor people assume is snowflake, but snowflake might not be the one. Instead, I believe it‚Äôs $CRM. They are slowly taking over every silo of enterprise software/data. CRM, project management, slack, workday (via partnership), etc. the vision is to have a unified system where every application sends through a stream of data for analysis on one platform. $CRM is trying to do this by being that unified vendor.

I believe the opposite to be the real future, that PLTR foundry is the unified platform wrapping all enterprise apps and collecting the streams of data for analysis.

So it‚Äôs either a 90% haircut (not 100% because there‚Äôs no bankruptcy risk) or a 20X return based on DCF modeling from these levels, as the company grows through its high growth segment of S curve.

People really allow price action to dictate their narrative, but stock prices doesn‚Äôt always follow product development and adoption here. As wallstreet analysts aren‚Äôt systems engineers. EPS has nothing to do with how the PLTR platform is being deployed and used by new customers who signed multi million dollar deals. I would change my hypothesis if I have facts that show customers are dumping the core product after several years of deployment and usage, but I have not seen that.

435,"You're not really helping the company much by buying their stock except for helping raise the price, but you're not buying $AAPL to help it grow or give it the 160. When stocks IPO, they have a set amount of shares they can sell and that's when the company will get their big bag of $$ usually. From then on they can look to sell more shares in a secondary offering, but you're not going to really help the company itself. 

Regarding stocks vs crypto, I will start with saying I don't personally believe in Crypto so I'm biased. When you buy a stock, you are buying something with a balance sheet and metrics that you can use to value it and judge if the stock is worth buying or not. Looking at AAPL, you're able to see how many phones/computers/iPad's they sold this year. You can see growth metric and how their healthy their balance sheet is. When you buy Bitcoin, there are no metrics that can tell you if it's undervalued or overvalued and there's also a lot less transparency &amp; regulations in the industry. You can argue that you can price bitcoin based on the cost of electricity, which i think is a valid argument. To me though it's just pure speculation. They also are more volatile typically when comparing to solid companies in the S&amp;P/Dow.  

To finalize my rant, I would recommend that if you want to be involved in the market and don't fully understand it, or follow it, to just buy some Index tracking ETF's. You can dollar cost average them (You put in ""X"" every month consistently. Some months you'll buy more others less, but you'll average out a good cost over time). If you do want to try buying single names that's fine but please do your research and buy things you believe in. I tell anyone who asks me for stock advice to buy companies they use frequently and think will be around in 20 years.

You still need  studs to anchor your team AAPL, GOOG, etc. but you also need to pick some little guys who will eventually become studs on your team. When a player is hot and it doesn't seem like he can keep it up, I'd sell him for a struggle player.

Either way, I distinctly remember a lot of the same rhetoric; that's why I put significant fractions of my portfolio into established blue chip techs such as CSCO and INTC. I also remember the same talk about share values reflecting really optimistic future growth numbers, as if the only alternative was total and complete bankruptcy (which is just such a poor model of the outcomes that I don't even know where to start). 

I've been an AAPL shareholder since like 95/96; I've made a metric ton of gains on that investment.

You might ask; why don't you sell and rebuy? The answer is simple; it's a very significant position that I will incur an equally significant tax bill on.

489,"The rate hikes are not the concern here. This isn't a normal hiking cycle so assuming this will play out as it has in normal hiking cycles of the past probably isn't a good strategy.

Normally when hiking cycles occur the FED isn't being forced to move by inflation. Normally when the market or economy reacts poorly to hikes the FED can just stop hiking or loosen monetary policy. This isn't really possible today because rates are so low and the balance sheet is already so high, but also because they have to move to address inflation. We all know that in the past inflation has been persistant when it's reached these levels and only a recession triggered by a rapid tightening of monetary policy has been shown to fix that trend when it gets started. This bet that inflation improves in the second half of this year is starting to look less and less likely. If inflation doesn't improve that you're looking at a very significant drop from here and potentially years of loses.

The FED clearly doesn't want to hike by the fact they've been delaying hiking and hoping inflation will go away for months at this point. They know there is now a very real risk they'll be backed into a corner and will need to choose between an inflationary spiral and a recession.

I'll also add that fundamentally the market is still expensive. This isn't really even dip, but more a minor reversion towards more normal valuations. Even if you remove all the economic risks I don't think stocks have much reason to rally from these levels. When sentiment turns negative like this investors look for strength in fundamentals and as much as people like to claim AAPL or indexes are fairly valued and a safe investment, these ""safety"" trades are all basically at ATH highs both in price and valuation. The idea someone would buy at this point thinking they're getting a bargain is insane. I strongly suspect those fleeing to safety are about to find this out in the coming weeks. You're right no body knows what the future will bring. A lot of people are programmed to buy the dip so we might just bounce back to the excessive valuations we saw towards the end of last year, it's just I don't know why someone would bet on that.",2022-02-21 15:54:29,2022-02-21,0.8215

492,"&gt; But surely if everyone is having a negative sentiment towards the market right now, presuming a war, and a crash, rising rates. Won‚Äôt all this be priced in? And if any good news happens the markets will rally?

I'm not sure everyone is negative, at least sentiment could get a lot worse. The fact people are still buying suggests we probably need to go lower.

""Priced in"" is mostly just a meme. The S&amp;P500 might need to drop 10% to price in rate hikes, but as that 10% drop occurs investors almost inevitably become fearful and will start to look for higher margins of safety. If investor sentiment changes then how far should prices drop? A lot of people believe valuations are determined by fundamentals, but this isn't strictly true. Prices in reality are determined entirely by investor psychology. The reason markets follow fundamentals over longer periods is simply because the fundamentals correlate with investor psychology. So when valuations are fundamentally attractive there are more investors with confidence to buy. Or put another way whether AAPL is worth 30 PE or 25 PE has less to do with fundamentals and more to do with current investor psychology, but at some valuation almost everyone will agree AAPL is worth its valuation which is the only reason fundamentals are important.

What bothers me about the situation right now is that things are at best fairly valued, but arguably still a bit expensive. That isn't a good bottom for any correction. Generally in times like this you can expect markets to overreact because when the market sells off investors get nervous. Similarly when markets rally investors become overly confident and take on more risk so they tend to overshoot fundamentals. Confidence during selloffs is only restored when opportunities become clear and risk looks minimal. As far as I can tell we're no where near that today. A bit of good news at this point probably isn't enough to stop the trend in the same way a bit of bad news isn't enough to end market rallies. You really need an exhaustion in bearish sentiment coupled with attractive valuations for a bottom. And on the flip side for bull rallies to end you typically need valuations to become extremely stretched coupled with some event that causes investors to reconsider valuations. Valuations just being high or a bit of bad news doesn't stop strong market rallies.

If you want my opinion, there's nothing attractive about this market right now. Sentiment is turning progressively negative. The FED backstop is probably gone for the first time in many years. Inflation data is becoming increasingly concerning. Valuations are still reasonably high even assuming various risks don't play out. Then you have all the other stuff going on with war, supply-chains, COVID, China, etc. In my opinion there's practically nothing right now that will push this market higher and plenty that could add to investor fears. People betting on stocks with stretched valuations going higher because inflation data improves a bit or the FED is a little more dovish than anticipated are out of their minds. For stocks to move higher from here you would need a significant change in the economic outlook and I can't see anything that would cause that. In 2018 when the FED announced balance sheet reduction was on autopilot stocks fell far more than today and probably would have continued falling if it wasn't for a complete u-turn by the FED. In 2020 when stocks sold off the FED again stepped in such a huge way that it allowed investors to revaluate risk and gave them the confidence to buy. Good luck on betting something like this happening today. At best you're likely to get marginally better than expected data for a few months while markets find a bottom. For me to feel fairly confident right now the PE on the S&amp;P500 would need to drop to around 19 or fundamentals would need to significantly and rapidly improve.

If you own decent businesses, it's probably worth stay invested though. You're not going to time a bottom perfectly because things tend to develop in unexpected ways. I just wouldn't bet on a reversal in anything right now. Stocks like FB are quite likely to remain cheap and continue to move lower for months in a market like this. Fundamentals don't really matter until they have to matter and when markets are trading at a 22+ PE multiple during a period of what's likely to be rapid monetary tightening no one out there with any sense is going to be thinking, ""man what a great time to buy"".",2022-02-21 12:20:35,2022-02-21,0.985

The most popular ETFs are capital weighted and have a trend following build inside. 
Increasing Investments in these funds increase demand in the biggest companies and vice versa.

Index funds control 17.2% of U.S.-listed companies, up from 3.5% in 2000.

This trend of the concentration of market cap in some mega- cap companies can be seen critical.

In my opinion, the only way it happens is if there's something that drives a massive migration out of the equity markets. That usually occurs when money moves into the bond market, but even with increasing rates I don't think we're anywhere near the levels where this becomes a true risk. Equities are still the place to store your capital, and until that changes AAPL will be one of the market darlings.",2022-02-21 07:40:23,2022-02-21,0.802
497,"I‚Äôm a shareholder of both MSFT and GOOGL so a bit bias, but *how much more* can they realistically fall? GOOGL is already under 24 PE, and MSFT is all things considered a bit more expensive at 30 (so it could have more room to fall), but these companies earn *absurd* amounts of money. MSFT and GOOGL are pretty much like mini tech ETF‚Äôs and in some way involved in all aspects of the world. I‚Äôm loading up on more shares. 

Even if they do fall lower, the next question is are they going anywhere. They have hundreds of billions in revenue and superb earnings. It‚Äôs not comparable to something like NVDA which has 30b in revenue and was worth nearly 1 trillion at some point.

1,"Just my two cents but AAPL I think like NFLX, reality will soon catch up with it. As we have read for a few years now, there's little reason to upgrade from say an iPhone X even to an iPhone 13 unless the battery is trash and you're due for a carrier upgrade.

I really like the M1 Macs, but they still have many limitations and being restricted to macOS is a double-edged sword (speaking as a software engineer typing this on an M1 Mac). Certainly Mac sales have been on the rise since M1 was launched, but dumb things like not being able to increase scaling on non-4K monitors, not being able to adjust brightness on external monitors (technically you can but it's not a great experience), base M1 SoC can only support two displays, and I still have bugs/issues with certain peripherals and adapters that work fine on Intel Macs and Intel/AMD PCs have me disappointed. Anyway most of us software engineers (and white collar employees as a whole) do not get to choose our computer and companies are still very much on the PC/Windows bandwagon. I would buy DELL before buying AAPL. Heck Dell's PE is like 9. 

Consider that AAPL is no longer a growth company, but is trading near ATH. They have long since leveled out in terms of iOS vs Android market share (globally), and Macs have always been a single-digit percentage of the PC market. I think growth would mostly come from Apple's subscription services like Apple TV+, but buying AAPL for Apple TV+ while selling DIS (some people do this) is dumb. I don't know anyone with Apple TV+ but I know plenty of people with Disney+, including myself. The catalog is unbeatable. I really think every single streaming service is going to bomb except Disney+, and perhaps HBO Max (Warner Bros Discovery/ WBD). Both have diverse catalogs that are reminiscent of Netflix circa 2014. Everyone has one or two shows that people like and that's not enough to command $5-10/month. People only get Paramount+ for Star Trek, Peacock for The Office, AMC+ for Better Call Saul and I assume Apple TV+ for the Ted Lasso because that's the only show I hear about on that service.",2022-04-26 02:33:28,2022-04-26,0.9682
2,"\- ARKK charges a high (like 1%) management fee, so I prefer to just look at their holdings and pick the few stocks that I like. For example, I have little faith in COIN but I like DKNG (I actually bother to look at companies' quarterly financials and so on).

\-  SNOW is interesting. I'm a software engineer and I talk to a lot of companies (interviewing and so forth) and nobody uses Snowflake. Obviously there are companies that do use it, but a safer bet would be MSFT or AMZN to capture those Azure and AWS cloud computing profits respectively. SNOW management has been cashing out which... the saying goes that insiders only buy for one reason (the stock is poised to go up) but sell for a myriad of reasons... but when they're all selling at the same time, you're wise to stay away for a while.

\- DIS is probably undervalued. It's trading around pre-covid prices but now we have Disney+ revenue and all this pent-up travel demand will likely make this Summer Disney's best Summer since 2019, possibly ever. That Star Wars hotel gets a lot of hate but go try to book a room, it's booked until August. Why believe what some random article says when you can go look at Disney's reservation site and see how in-demand it is. If DeSantis holds on dissolving Reedy Creek Improvement District (likely, he is a son of a bitch) that will amount to a one-time tax break for DIS which will pump its earnings for FY 2023 (Reedy Creek won't dissolve until 2023). Only risk here is if a Democrat wins the Florida gubernatorial election in the fall (unlikely). I wouldn't try to swing-trade this, too much FUD driving it down, but it may pop in the fall when DIS reports they raked in the dough from parks and cruises over the summer.

\- AMD Really a no-brainer if you ask me. People keep piling into NVDA, but I think AMD is the safer bet. Both are in the ML/AI space, but AMD is more diversified being they manufacture CPUs and custom SoCs for things like the Playstation 5 and Xbox One Series X. Intel is floundering, so AMD is my favorite of those three. Keep an eye on the acquisitions, Diworsification is a risk, but so far I am cool with everything Dr. Su is buying. I think she's setting up AMD to make money hand over fist in the coming years. Also consider ASX and AMKR- they test/QC semiconductors, not necessarily for AMD or Intel (to be honest I don't actually know), but the earnings for both have been growing steadily and they trade at a fraction of the PE something like AMD is trading at. I think FUD regarding China-Taiwan tension keeps them in check, but they both aren't only in Taiwan. If you're bullish on semiconductor sector you have to own ASX and AMKR, period. Oh also, if the government passes some stimulus bill like Build Back Better, AMD and INTC are poised to get corporate welfare to help them build fabs in the US or whatever. My guess is the bill won't require INTC or AMD to spend the money on anything in particular, and it will just be a one-time boost to AMD's balance sheet. Intel will probably do the same thing. Building fabs in the US is a lousy proposition, especially with inflation and so many companies facing unionization efforts... but Republicans would absolutely give them no-strings-attached money anyway. Keep a close eye on politicians picking up AMD/INTC and probably load up as soon as you see them start loading up. This might be in 2025, or it might be later this year, hard to say.

\- MGM has really let their hotels go over the last couple of years in an effort to minimize losses from COVID. They own most of the Las Vegas Strip and manage the Delano. I guess I wouldn't bet against Vegas, but I was there in November and I personally see their revenue from hotels/gambling only going down from here on out. Companies like DraftKings are the future of betting/gambling. MGM has gone big on online betting with Bet MGM, but so have CZR (Caesar's) and BALY (Bally's), LVS (Las Vegas Sands) and WYNN (Wynn). History has shown us time and again that you can be right as rain about an industry booming, but wrong about the company. So many tech companies failed in 2000-2001, but you were riding high if you stuck with MSFT and AAPL, especially to today. To me, DKNG is the least-risky and most-poised for long-term success. Ignoring the risk of being in hospitality on the verge of a supposed recession, Las Vegas is in a desert, and I am always reading articles about how the Colorado River is lower than expected and demand way outstrips supply and so on, yet more people moved to Las Vegas since 2020 than most other cities in the US. It's top 5 iirc. Eventually they will have to run a pipeline out from California and attach it to some big, expensive desalination plant. It's not a big deal if they power it with nuclear, but nuclear gets so much hate... Anyway, I wonder who will end up footing the bill for that pipeline out to Vegas. There will be a lot of panic selling before then, though. I just don't see how you can invest in any company based in Vegas right now. We all know they have x years of water left. [https://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2021/aug/16/western-states-face-first-federal-water-cuts/](https://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2021/aug/16/western-states-face-first-federal-water-cuts/) Looks like (if my math is right and if trends continue) Lake Mead will be too low for Hoover Dam to generate power in \~30-35 years. I guess arguably most of us don't have to worry about it. It's hard to say though, it depends on how many people move out west to places like Phoenix and Las Vegas, and how much snowfall the Rockies get each year.

\- PYPL competes with Zelle, CashApp and Venmo in the payment space, and competes with Gemini (not public), Robinhood (HOOD) and probably a few other exchanges for crypto. Their association with the scummy eBay won't be doing them any favors either. I just don't see a reason to buy it. I don't see why it would grow.

\- TSLA is a tough one. Don't listen to me on TSLA, but from my perspective, between the quality control standards (panel gaps and so on), the fact that \*every\* auto manufacturer is working on EVs (many have EVs on the market), the fact that auto is cyclical, and the fact that their PE is out of this world... I would never touch it. I think there are too many other, less-risky, cheaper companies out there that one can buy.

Like is it coming from supply chain disruption issue? Or is it coming from enhanced demand due to all accomodative fiscal policy (both from fed and government aid)?

29,"The markets don't care about current earnings, they care about earning expectations. If the market believes rates will continue to rise and earnings growth will continue weaken then that dramatically changes valuations.

I think most companies will probably post decent earnings this quarter, but the thing to look out for is the guidance. For example, if GOOG says they project digital ad spend growth to slow in the coming year due to reopening trends and weakening business confidence then valuations need to come down. Same could happen with AAPL as they're probably one of the more sensitive companies to a weaker consumer. Even if iPhone sales were great this quarter if they anticipate they could slow in the coming quarters then the stock is going to fall.

I do agree that some people are too bearish right now though because economic conditions are changing so quickly it's silly to be all in or all out. It's quite possible over the next few weeks we could get some positive news that will act as a support for current valuations. China ending lockdowns or Russia ending the war in Ukraine for example would be seen as very favourably by the market. The big one though would be signs that inflation is peaking. Even if inflation remains elevated for some time a clear peak in the inflation data would take away the risk of an even more hawkish FED and a potential recession.

Things could easily get worse though, and it's not hard to imagine how that might happen given all the risks. Still, most stocks are down significantly from their highs already. It's worth remembering how in the average bear market stocks fall around 30% and there's a ton of really great companies down 20% or more right now.

Don‚Äôt get too excited about short term issues like the asinine ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say gay‚Äù stuff.  Disney is a family friendly company, and as such they *have* to be supportive of families. In today‚Äôs world that includes gay families and families with gay family members. The majority of Americans support gay families, so Disney will also support gay families.  Id be surprised if Disney stayed silent or supported Floridas position.  

If you think it‚Äôs actually an issue, as yourself this: Does Apple‚Äôs very public position on gay rights affect how many people buy iPhones?

As to streaming, the only way Disney streaming suffers the same issue Netflix did would be if they suddenly started cracking down on password sharing and stopped creating great content, so likely not a problem in this multiverse. 

As for talent, Disney is *the* magnet for it. There were a couple of hiccups as Disney tried to figure out how to monetize films during the pandemic. Warner Brothers, Paramount and all the other studios also has issues‚Ä¶ Poorly managed pandemic responses will do that to a company that relies on public entertainment. But don‚Äôt think that any of those stumbles will continue now that most everything and everyone has figured out how to go back out in public again.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are the lessons I learned in the last two decades:

If you are shooting for 10x or 100x, Founder/CEO makes the biggest difference. 

If you diversify enough, you should just go with the index. 

If you buy individual stocks, you should thoroughly research the companies so you fully understand why these companies will beat the index by a wide margin in the long run.

If the stock doesn't have a clear probability to get 10X in 10 years, just skip it.

Cut loss, don't buy more to average cost lower.

- I‚Äôm seeing more people traveling more over the next few months since 2019
- Inflation is a bitch but it hardly impacts people in the upper class and upper middle class who say own their home and work professional jobs with decent mobility to say move companies for more $$$ (great resignation anyone?
- Dumbass DeSantis will only double-down on the repeal of Reedy Creek Improvement District, despite the consensus being it reduces Disney‚Äôs debt and expenses and increases the tax burden on locals.
- Recent price movement seems to be driven by NFLX‚Äôs lousy performance, but Disney+ is not Netflix. Consider this: you could have been right as rain about personal computers being the next big thing in 1985, bought AAPL, and dumped it for a significant loss in 1999 as bankruptcy loomed. The fate of an industry does not set the fate of a company. Disney+ most recently beat on subscriber growth, and they will capture yet more $ with the incoming ad-supported plan.
- Disney World and Disneyland are packed, and have been for at least a year now. I went there, and for some reason, it was packed. No fireworks show at the time, half of Epcot under construction, but the Frozen ride line went all the way to China, and you couldn‚Äôt get a table at a restaurant without a reservation. 
- There‚Äôs at least one article circulating that the Star Wars hotel is underperforming‚Ä¶ you can take them at their word, or you can go to Disney‚Äôs website and try to book a room. You get bubkus until August. There‚Äôs also word that a significant portion of the first-time guests plan on coming back and paying for that Star Wars experience a second time.

Most of the patrons complaining about Disney‚Äôs recent price-gouging actions in the parks, don‚Äôt seem to realize that Disney doesn‚Äôt need nor want their business. I grew up in Florida and we were absolutely net losses for Disney. Pay $200 (at the time) for an annual pass, park at Downtown Disney (Disney Springs) to avoid paying for parking, eat and stay off-resort. Nobody who lives in Florida is going to pay $1000/night to stay at the Contemporary Resort üòÇ

As packed as Disney World is, their raising prices is Economics 101. They‚Äôve already been at the point where the parks are at capacity since 2020. Part of that is the parks operating at limited capacity, but I bet they will keep that ‚Äúyou must have a reservation to enter the park‚Äù system indefinitely.

Disney will absolutely mint money from here on out, mark my words. I put my money where my mouth is and DCA $20/day into DIS ($5.2k/year) on top of occasional large buys ($100-500 or so) when I see a short term volatility play.

53,"&gt;(1) Do I invest myself or go to a broker? Pros &amp; cons of each? 

Seeing as investing money can‚Äôt be completed without a broker in the first place‚Ä¶.this is a pretty easy question to answer.

As for pros and cons, they vary by broker, so you would be wise to do your research. 

&gt;(2). If I invest myself is it better to use apps like Robinhood or other trading apps or what else.

Robinhood is a broker. Pretty much every trading app out there is associated with a brokerage firm. 

&gt;(3) What are some ‚Äúgood‚Äù stock options for people looking to start?

Index funds like SPY, VOO, VTI, etc, or blue chips like AAPL, MSFT, etc. 

&gt;(4) Which are better high-risk high rewards or low-risk low rewards?

This is a subjective question, as it depends on your risk tolerance. If you‚Äôre young, with plenty of time till retirement, you should own risky assets like stock, because you have time to ride out the ups and downs of the market. 

If you are approaching retirement, you would want to own low-risk assets like bonds, so should the market get wild, your money is safe.

&gt;(5) Short term or long term holding?

Long term is ideal.

&gt;(6) What would be a ‚Äúgood‚Äù amount to start investing with?

Whatever you can afford to invest, and be comfortable with potentially losing 100% of. 

&gt;(7) How do you file the taxes of stock? (Do you have to pay taxes for the stock if you haven‚Äôt sold it by the end of a tax year?)

Your broker will send you the appropriate tax forms pertinent to all account activity. If you‚Äôve bought and sold stock, expect a 1099-B detailing all transactions.

Collected a certain amount in dividends or interest? Expect 1099-DIV/1099-INT respectively. 

&gt;(9) How do I get companies‚Äô financial reports and other information? 

This can usually be found online, and as for ‚Äúother information‚Äù check the SEC‚Äôs EDGAR database for the specific stock you want information on. 

&gt;(10) What kinds of stocks should I avoid?

Penny stocks for the most part. 

&gt;(11) What is an ‚ÄúIPO‚Äù and should those be invested in or avoided?

In the words of Jordan Belfort, ‚ÄúAn I.P.O. is an initial public offering. It's the first time a stock is offered for sale to the general population.‚Äù

As for investing in them or not, it‚Äôs up to you to read the prospectus attached to the offering, and come to your own conclusion whether it is suitable to invest in or not.",2022-04-24 02:20:42,2022-04-24,0.9926

On the other you have Lisa Su saying greater than 30% organic revenue growth YoY, as recently as the end of march iirc. Who do you trust?

AMD still has the best server products (by far) and only has 20% of market share. The market share of intel and amd will invert in server, if amd's tech remains superior. The 5 year roadmap of AMD looks very good. Even if there were Zero growth in server over the next 5 years, AMD's server business has plenty of room to run. But of course, servers are growing like a weed. There will be contrarians who say that ARM and AAPL/AMZN homegrown servers will reduce sales, but they are just two companies. There are literally thousands of companies who have need of high throughput computing-- even companies like Specialized, a cycling company, is using HPC to model how they design their bikes. Modeling/machine learning is absolutely booming in application, from protein shape modeling, drug interactions, to aerodynamics, optimizing power grids/water supply for crops, etc. There is efficiency to be obtained, there are cost savings to be had.

AMD is not just a gaming company, not just a crypto enabler, not just a niche server market of programming nerds. But even in personal computers, the same can be said about market share. Even a flat sector could still have room for considerable AMD growth. Intel's products for personal computers are much more competitive for now, but we will have to see what this year brings. Intel has clung to performance by blowing out the watts, and still wins on single core performance, at least last I checked. However, the world is getting more multithreaded, not less, and I see more avenues opening up for power-thrifty and multithreaded amd cores. Both will have a place, but again we are talking about market share here. 

I think the market is being absolutely ridiculous right now, treating AMD's share price as if there were 30% dilution without any revenue/earnings growth-- the XLNX acquisition. There was also the expiration of that 1-time tax credit in Q4 2020 on our 1-year performance, so it ""looks like"" everything is going downhill if you google AMD (everything is red). And then they say the sector is downcycling. Terror. Panic in the streets! Dump the shares!

A few things that I think will happen:

1. Intel has a poor earnings report. People think the sector is slowing down. Maximum Fear of Morons hits.
2. AMD comes out with an incendiary $1.15-$1.35 EPS on the last 3 months and guides 35% revenue growth on the year, citing ""incremental chip supply gains"". 
3. The stock responds accordingly.

94,"Well, first thing is that interest rate hikes isn't going to do much for a cashflow positive company that has a ton of cash and is trading at a 21 PE. These moves have far more to do with the market pricing in the effects of the economy reopening and a potential recession in my opinion.

The bear case for GOOG is pretty obvious if you look at the numbers. GOOG had huge growth and margin expansion over the last few years because everyone was at home watching YouTube instead of being at work and going on holiday. Further, for the last couple of years every business has been trying to sell online to make up for revs lost to lockdowns so digital ad spend went through the roof.

What do you think is going to happen now the economy is reopening? Do you think digital ad spend is going to continue to grow at the same pace it has the last coupe of years? Might it even roll off a bit this quarter? Then you need to ask what happens if GOOG's margins drop from the 30% they saw last year back to the 20% they had prior to the pandemic? That alone could cause them to miss earnings by 33% which starts to makes the stock look far more expensive.

I'm not saying GOOG's earnings are about to fall off a cliff, but it's a pandemic winner which is likely to see some headwinds from the economy reopening. We've already seen disappointing numbers from NFLX so now the market seems to be worried about anything that benefited from the pandemic in case earnings and growth is not sustainable.

Lastly, GOOG as an ad platform has a lot of exposure to small business. If we get a recession small businesses are going to pullback on ad spend. They're also a global company so a pullback in digital ad spend in Europe is going to hurt them regardless of how great the US economy is doing.

We have a ton of tech earnings coming up next week and so far the only large tech player to report earnings missed massively despite expectations already being pretty low. What do you think happens if pandemic winners like GOOG or AAPL also miss next week? I think a lot of what happened this week is simply investors being terrified that GOOG or AAPL could drop 25% on a bad earnings miss. I remember before FB tanked earlier this year everyone was saying how cheap it looked and would probably do well when earnings were reported, but now they're trading at a 13 PE... I've noticed people have been saying the same about GOOG recently. It's quite possible the market has seen something that those just looking at the PE multiple in a vacuum haven't.",2022-04-22 22:05:41,2022-04-22,-0.6868

116,"Yes the term ""Boomer"" as an insult must be erased from the idiom. Boomers are simply people 70 years old or more and they are generally wiser, though sometimes they miss the boat on mod high tech movements and not all boomers are financially secure, many lost in life and fell through the cracks, but let's concentrate on the financially okay or better Boomers.  They have real estate, blue chip stocks, dividends and social security, plus many inherited from their dead parents, so they are usually doing quite well.

If I were a 45 year old prepping for retirement, I would make sure I have a nice home (though dont buy at the top of the market), accumulate a few million in blue chip stocks like AAPL, along with some boring income stocks like VZ or T, and then if I wanted to I would put aside money I can afford to lose and use it to play and trade.  So even if I lose, I am still okay. Of course all this depends on making a good living, avoiding disasters and even not having children as kids are the biggest expense, along with health problems and nasty alimonies.

119,"At the end of the day no one knows what's going to happen. Looks like you have a pretty good feel for things, however, so I'll share some of my thoughts that might help complete your theory. 

The only thing I've found reliable is to look at history how frothy markets tend to move in the end game. (Whether it be in the dot-com bubble, or the crypto bubble in 2017, etc.) There is a lot of evidence out there that growthy/frothy stocks tend to get pummeled first, and then finally the large caps come down at the very end. I think the rationale is that investors leave the riskiest names first and rotate to safer ones. However, even the safer ones start to become a problem when there are major structural issues/overall pessimism in the markets. Bull markets don't last forever and sometimes having no position is the best thing.

So far it's playing out exactly how it played out in the dot-com bubble. I've been shorting speculative/high PS ratio stocks since November, got cut a little bit on the rebound in late March, but have been recently closing them. Last week I began sizing into shorts in expensive large cap stocks like $COST, $AAPL, $ABBV, $DE, to name a few. While growthy names can continue to slide downwards, the risk-reward isn't there anymore. Most of the names I shorted ($CVNA, $NET, $HUBS, $SHOP, etc.) have had large enough drawdowns and asking for another 50% more would be asking a lot. The large cap non-tech stocks I mentioned above, however, are a completely different story. You're spot on with the likes of $COST. They are extremely expensive right now, and while I wouldn't expect a 50% drawdown, I think a 20-30% drop is reasonable from here to reset valuations.

The stock market hasn't been listening to the bond market for the past few weeks. When it eventually does, turbulence will come fast. Honestly, you really can't fault funds/investors/retail for greeding hard for large-cap names like $AAPL and $COST.  A true bear market hasn't happened for more than a decade. In that time span, fortunes and careers were made off of being a perma-bull. Unfortunately, the vast majority of investors are perma-bulls now. Who can blame them? Year after year it's been ingrained in every investor that being a bear is a losing endeavor. Buy the f*cking dip if you want to succeed. Only when you see the large-cap names fall will the S&amp;P500 enter a true bear market. Only when we have a real bear market will stubborn perma-bulls be wiped away.",2022-04-22 06:18:13,2022-04-22,0.968

If they become compounding machines over the long term (10+ years), then you will feel a sizable, impactful effect on your portfolio from those small amounts. The compounders over time become large enough that they have a life of their own in your portfolio and some spit out cash that in turn can be redeployed elsewhere. 

During what felt like a very long nevative period of AAPL tanking some 40% between Sep 2012 to mar 2013, I scaled down into 832 shares in AAPL 
$2k to $3k worth of shares at a time. Each buy  felt like a small non-impactful amount but my goal was to scale till we reached the bottom and I was regularly in the red for each of those buys. It felt like forever and at times I questioned my AAPL thesis and conviction as the $14k total investment during that AAPL downtrend was a sizable portion of the portfolio and I felt I was too overweight and taking a single stock gamble that AAPL would eventually rebound over the long term. Things worked out after Carl Icahn took an activist position and triggered a rebound. That $14k is now worth some $140k excluding dividends. 

I had another $10k AAPL buy for 272 shares during the Christmas bear of 2018 which felt like a sizable  amount and is now worth some $45K. 

So my goal for all my long term positions are that they end up being serial compounders in total return. Sometimes they will do nothing for years at a stretch but if the fundamentals are in place and business reinvents or grows, you will get some compensation in terms of total return. 

May feel small initially but if you are consistent, avoid anything childish and stupid like meme chasing,  brute force the stock market with all the excess cash you can with little to no trading ambitions and have a super long term view, your small amount contributions snowball into a sizable beast.

198,"For the sake of the discussion, I'll make an argument generally against mega caps &amp; market-cap weighted indices like the S&amp;P500...

Over the last couple of decades the largest companies the US indexes have massively benefited from the growth of large, multinational software companies. Some of these companies are now so large that you can measure their revenues as a percentage of US GDP. This is a concern because the S&amp;P500 is basically just a collection of the largest 500 companies listed in the US, it's not necessarily a bet on the US economy as many people think. For example, it's theoretically possible that GDP in the US could grow while the largest companies in the US could see their earnings decline. The reverse is also true.

Today the only reason companies like AAPL, GOOG, MSFT and AMZN can sustain their huge revenues because of their international exposure. If over the next decade the world becomes less globalised while economic areas such as Europe continue to tighten their regulation against US tech it's quite possible we'll see the S&amp;P500 and mega caps underperform while international &amp; small-cap stocks outperform.

IMO the primary risk for mega caps is there level of international exposure. Today it's become quite easy to imagine a scenario where the CCP decides to support domestic phone manufactures by blocking the sell of Apple / Android devices, while Europe continues to regulate Apple and Google's ecosystems. You can see how this might hurt their bottom lines even if the US economy continues to grow at a healthy pace. And given the weighting of tech in the major indexes these types of headwinds could present a significant drag on the returns of US indices over the next decade should they play out.

I'm not personally looking to increase my portfolio weighting to international &amp; small-cap stocks just yet given large caps are probably more defensive for the time being given economic uncertainties, but going forward I do play to allocate more to small caps because I don't think the world will tolerate US tech companies become ever more dominant and exerting ever more social and political influence forever.

Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks - W1 SMA(200) (blue on the picture) and min/max price from last 200 weeks - W1 MIN(200), W1 MAX(200) (both yellow on the picture). All these indicators are used for is to determine ultra conservatively what is the ""cheap"" price.

Add up new investment money every 6 months - as much as comfortable.  
What to use them for?

P. S. W1 = 1 Week candlestick timeframe

1. Split ur total investment money into 4 equal piles.

2. Invest one pile per crossing critical weekly structure (3 descibed below) - weekly structures are meaningful in moves many years across

3. No matter how much you invested, sell 1/2 of the investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line - after this you can again buy from the first place - W1 SMA200  
Notice that you should pick stocks on which you have at least an 80-200% target if the price goes back to the MAX(200).  
3. Invest 1 pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line

  
4. Invest the 1  pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line

  
5. Invest 2 piles when the price goes under the W1 MIN(200) as far as it is to the MAX(200) from the W1 MIN(200)

  
6. Hold 1/2 of the position in profit until you are happy with the profit (up to you, I recommend at least 3 years more after crossing W1 MAX(200) upwards).   


  
This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!  
If you stopped liking the stock you invested in fundamentally after you invested, just go with it and try to take profit when the price bounces from one of your buy orders and overall you did profit from the stock.

  
This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on mediocre stock (TDOC) and 5-10 years on trusted stock (MSFT, AAPL).  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have the balls to ignore them  


c) with this strategy you will rarely get fully out of cash - this may be hard to stand.  
This should be used on assets that are growing forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).  
I really advise buying something that is traded publicly for at least 5 years.  


Profits can be reinvested.

247,"My largest position is in AAPL. I've owned it for over a dozen years, and it has made me a fortune, so I definitely agree with you there. Unfortunately, all of the FAANG's are overpriced on a fundamental basis.

The problem is that the mega-caps that you mentioned aren't going to achieve the kind of growth that MELI, PLTR, and SE will, nor will those three be at these generational buying opportunity prices forever. MELI is the AMZN of Latin America. PLTR is the company that I believe is best positioned to capitalize on many important trends across many different industries, and it has a significant head start and moat. SE is the pseudo-AMZN of Southeast Asia. If you want high growth and safety, it's hard to beat them.

P/E isn't a metric normally applied to growth stocks. (It doesn't make sense to time how long a future Olympian takes to crawl a 100-meter race as a baby!) I think you mean P/S. The P/S ratio tells you how much you'd be paying for growth, so you need to make sure that a company of interest really will have that growth, to the best of your ability to discern. Although we can't predict the future or avoid risk, including Black Swan events, we can nevertheless make strong bets. Life, itself, is full of risks. The stock market is no different.

Most of the crushing for the growth stocks that are actually strong and growing is over. Barring a nuclear strike or drastic change in market conditions, MELI won't be returning to $800/share, for instance.

Most retail investors have a hard time anticipating what's likely to happen, so they wind up being late to the party and overpaying for ""value"" companies and never manage to buy into worthwhile growth stocks when they're trading for less than they should be, or they wind up buying growth companies at the peak, with tragically predictable consequences. In other words, institutions are constantly ahead of retail investors in this regard; retail investors are always one or more steps behind. I'm trying to help others to bend the odds in their favor.

The time to go long on a promising company isn't after it has risen dramatically, and the YouTube-Reddit press is hyping them. To the contrary, it's when there's a long period of price consolidation, preferably resulting in volatility contraction, and when people believe that the company is undesirable, but they don't really understand the growth drivers, moat, TAM, and operating performance.

In the end, what matters between 1 Jan and 31 Dec is how you do relative to SPY and QQQ. We use QQQ because it's a higher benchmark. Up until recently, growth stocks were a losing proposition. The best of them are now approaching reasonable entry points.

Since we don't expect the Fed to go crazy (which would cause a recession and create all sorts of problems for servicing US debt due to dramatically higher interest rate payments, which is opposed by both political parties), it's unlikely that you'll see a significant drop in the best of the growth stocks from the current prices. They give you a significant margin of safety and growth, which will greatly aid long-term wealth building. Most of the decimation on growth stock share prices resulting from expected increases in interest rates has already been priced in.

Good Luck,

I‚Äôm not familiar with the gaming subs, but if you have to have it to use your Xbox, it‚Äôs a great recurring revenue stream, but I question the opportunity for growth. 

As far as Azure, I think there is a significant opportunity there. I know every company I‚Äôve ever worked for needs to switch to Azure, and none have yet. I suspect that‚Äôs true for many companies. Now as to the growth potential on that front, I would even know how to begin to quantify that. 

As far as GOOGL, I think they have to ability to monetize a lot more than they do currently. They have us by the balls, and they ratchet the price WAY up before people begin to try to find an alternative. They also have a quantum computer that will be coming around soon.

""Buy low sell high"" works if you know what the ""low"" and the ""high"" is. If you stare only at a chart, a given stock might be historically low, but it might also be low for a bunch of reasons. 

Why would the price of a stock tank? Plenty of reasons: Massive write-downs that obliterate the balance sheet, a failed venture into Russia, production facilities burning down, management got caught for defrauding investors, getting caught for fudging the numbers, all revenue is tied to a single customer that went bankrupt...

All of these and more are reasons for the price of a stock to go ""low"". Doesn't mean you should buy it because they are probably the reason why it's tanking.

Yes, if a meme coin doubles in value and you bought it, you've doubled your money. However, if a meme coin is just a rug pull, you lose all your money. The vast majority of meme coins fail miserably.

Think about it like this: If you bought a stock for $10k at $50 per share and it goes to zero, how much money did you lose? 

Now compare that to you waiting for the stock to go to $20 per share and you bought $10k worth of stock but the stock still goes to zero, how much did you now lose?

Small cap investing is where you can make the best returns because it is more likely that you will find something that others haven't yet. It is very unlikely that you know something that a billion other AAPL investors haven't priced in yet, but it's entirely possible that you've found a small cap stock that's undervalued. 

Also, it's more likely that a successful small cap stock will double, triple or 100x in value than it is that AAPL will go from a trillion dollar company to a ten trillion dollar company.

I have no idea how sustainable last years revenue or margins are, but if I were buying here that's something I'd want to know.

GOOG also has a lot of exposure to small business and small business could struggle in an environment of high inflation, tightening monetary policy and potentially a recession. I have no idea how likely small business ad spend is to drop from economic weakness, but it's a risk to be aware of.

Finally 22 PE is not a bargain. 22 PE is somewhere around the average valuation of what a mega-cap growth stocks might have traded at historically. I feel like we're forgetting that stocks like AAPL used to trade in the teens and GOOG has often traded in the low 20 PEs.

My fear with tech stocks right now is that we're comparing valuations to those of the last few years during a period of time when they've all been extremely elevated. A forward PE of 22 for GOOG is around average historically, which doesn't seem quite as attractive when you consider the fact rates are going higher everyday and GOOG has possibly had an unsustainable run in recent years. It could easily go lower. A high teens PE wouldn't be crazy for GOOG right now given the growth risks and market sentiment right now.

324,"I think generally speaking during bull markets index funds will outperform, as illustrated by your numbers where someone buys at the bottom.  However, when valuations get stretched, individual stocks become a better bet.  That could be small cap growth, like AAPL (back then), or blue-chip dividends payers, like MMM.

This is because when you buy an index, you buy all the overvalued stocks without discretion.  If the market is overvalued, your index fund is overvalued.  There's no getting around it.  In these times, you may be better off looking for better deals, and the numbers I presented prove it, at least historically speaking.

The benefit of index funds is just what you say: companies get swapped in and out, so there's a lot less risk there than with an individual companies.  But you can achieve something similar by holding a diversified basket of stocks.

If someone just wants to dollar cost average into index funds over a period of decades, I imagine they will end up doing quite well, because there will be periods of booms and then busts.  It's the easy, passive solution. 
But anyone who wants to dig just a tad bit deeper would be able to see that the current valuations on index funds are stretched right now.  It took 25 years to recover from 1929.  If you just kept averaging down during that time, you'd do well, but there's also no logical reason to buy at the top of the bubble. It destroys your returns.",2022-04-12 20:10:24,2022-04-12,0.9272

But I had had a sudden hunch that this was the best day ever to buy. I had no cash but I had $250,000 in home equity and I borrowed that, put it all into Apple and Whole Foods and that got me out of debt within 9 months. In choosing those stocks I asked ""what will young people keep buying even in a depression?""  iPhones and healthy foods.  But I took a big risk.  and also other times went I went into debt to buy more AAPl (only at times when it had been selling off and Wall St was down on the stock) .

As for income, I failed at my first career so I started selling stuff in my house online to make cash. I had a big library and sold all my books. Turns out they were worth $7000, so then once I'd sold them all I looked around for more used books to sell.  Two years later my entire house was a book warehouse selling on amazon. I was very very good at it and perfectly positioned geographically. Plus since I had no family I could devote myself 24/7.  Then like I said, I kept sweeping my excess earnings into more Apple.

Yea So we are currently in a shift from Growth to Value. Look back in time at a MSFT during the dot com bubble of 1999-2000 and a chart of X (US Steel). Notice what MSFT did after the tech bubble collapsed for the next 13 years.. nothing. Now notice what X did during that same time frame.. $10 to $200. This same rotation is already underway. The trashy growth stocks get smashed first, then higher quality, then eventually they come for the leaders. All growth stocks will get crushed and do nothing over the next 5 years while Value stocks rise up and become the new momentum stocks. Its already happening. Materials and Oil stocks have had massive returns. What makes this time WAY worse then the dot com bubble is the concentration of 30% of the QQQ in like 6 stocks. When the leavy breaks (and it will) all that money hiding out in AAPL, Googl, MSFT, etc will move to value in mass. You can go buy growth stocks that are down 80-90%. They probably wont go much lower. Doesn't mean they are going to go up. Why sit in a portfolio of assets that aren't preforming ? I don't typically trade ""the market"" but my expectations are for zero to single digit growth in the indexes for the next 3-4 years.

344,"Leading stocks generally stall / fall because valuations and growth expectations were too high, not because they stopped growing or got smaller.

For example, if you look at the operating margins of tech companies today they're insane. This is the real the reason why tech dominates. It doesn't matter if you're a car company, a phone company or a cloud company, if you have crazy margins and decent growth at scale you'll be at the top of the indexes. For large companies which can't grow revenue as effectively anymore, margins are really all that matters. The question you should be asking isn't whether a company like GOOG will be bigger in a decade, but where their margins are heading. If a company's margins contract by 50% they would need 100% revenue growth to make up for this. And the problem for the mega caps is that they're so large doubling in size isn't easy anymore.

It's just a fact that as companies grow old they tend to become bloated and less efficient. Margins always begin to flatten out, as does growth. But times continue to change and technology continues to evolve... Smaller, more nimble startup companies will continue to hop onto new trends that are at overlooked by the larger companies (EVs, bitcoin, the internet, etc). Most of these startup companies will fail, but a few will stumble onto something revolutionary and experience the rapid growth and high margins associated with this new industry. As time goes on the older mega-cap tech companies will continue to see slower growth and their margins will begin to fall, both from increased competition and from bloat. As margins and growth falls, so do their elevated valuations. Slowly the innovative companies rise to take their place and go on to dominate for a decade or two before also beginning their slow decline. A company like AMZN might always be around, but in a decade or two it might look more like IBM does today -- still relevant, but not like it was in the past.

In my opinion FB is quite likely to be a smaller company in a decade's time. AAPL potentially could be too. I think there is still a lot of growth left in cloud names (MSFT &amp; AMZN) and I don't see Google slowing anytime soon, but it would be a mistake to believe big tech companies will grow and continue to expand margins forever. Both MSFT and AMZN are huge companies and trade at significant premiums to the market. Should their margins drop and growth slow these companies could struggle to ever reach their COVID hype highs. People thought companies like CSCO were the future in the 90s. Arguably INTC is another darling from a couple of decades ago that is now dying after having a good run.

Just don't underestimate what can change in a decade. When I think back a decade ago FB was loved by everyone. Now it seems kind of crazy to think people were actually interested enough in FB that they would make a movie about FB and Zuckerberg. But back then Zuckerberg was kind of seen as Elon is today, and hardly anyone one knew who Elon was in the early 2010s. Things will almost certainly change in ways you can't even imagine in a decades time. Big tech companies may be the future, but who knows who will be the big tech players of the next decade.",2022-04-11 23:53:13,2022-04-11,0.9936

For anyone who says ""well hindsight is 20/20"", I would have told you this months ago.

Value Line investment survey is a great tool for researching stocks.  Most public libraries have an online subscription that's free for patrons to use.  VL rates AAPL to outperform the market and also as low risk.

As my portfolio is mixed it tends to be value stocks are going up when growth is going down and vice versa so I sell Puts against the red part. If I get called I just take the shares and sell calls usually also selling more puts to the other side of the portfolio which at this point is red. If you are interested my portfolio is below. 

It's a large mix than traditionally recommended consisting of 78 stocks which I yearly generally replace 3-5 with new names. I generally try to keep position size about 20k per ticker except for things like GOOG and ASML due to stock price.

438,"PE ratios are \~20 (AAPL), \~40 (AMD) and \~60 (NVDA). People will tell you AMD and NVDA are way overvalued. In a way they are, and certainly the PEs paint them as such, but if it were as simple as selling stocks above a certain PE and buying stocks below a certain PE we would all be rich.

Do your own research, but I like AMD's prospects the most out of the three. I think it's a matter of when, not if, Congress passes a big, fat stimulus package for chip makers like INTC and AMD. AMD's recent acquisition of Pensando makes them more competitive with Intel, which makes more than just CPUs. Intel also makes WiFi/Bluetooth modules, SSDs, I think a few other things, though I believe they gave up on the cellular modems. Dr. Su pulled off an outstanding recovery when AMD was on the brink of bankruptcy circa 2016 and I have confidence that she is choosing acquisitions very carefully and purposefully. 

Apple has slowing iPhone sales to contend with. Their M1 SoC is neato but I am selling my M1 MacBook and buying a Surface Pro 8. Still too many growing pains for more than YouTube and Office. A lot of software engineers/companies that hire software engineers are buying up the more expensive ($2-4k) MacBook Pros, but I think it's a little early to make the jump to ARM from x86. It's like electric cars... are they the future? Yes. Does that mean there's no demand for ICE cars? No. 

I think it's musical chairs for all three, and it's just about not being the one holding the bag when the music stops. That said, I think AMD has steam left.

You might look at Dell. It only has a PE of 4 but obviously AMD's good fortune is Dell's good fortune and vice-versa. Analysts can shit on it all they like, but I love their laptops, monitors and PowerEdge servers.",2022-04-08 03:01:39,2022-04-08,0.9944
439,"So a lot of people seem to be asking for an investment strategy.  
Such a strategy does not have to be complex. I am sharing mine below.

My strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks - W1 SMA(200) (blue on the picture) and min/max price from last 200 weeks - W1 MIN(200), W1 MAX(200) (both yellow on the picture). All these indicators are used for is to determine ultra conservatively what is the ""cheap"" price.

Add up new investment money every 6 months - as much as comfortable.  
What to use them for?

P. S. W1 = 1 Week candlestick timeframe

1. Split ur total investment money into 4 equal piles.

2. Invest one pile per crossing critical weekly structure (3 descibed below) - weekly structures are meaningful in moves many years across

3. No matter how much you invested, sell 1/2 of the investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line - after this you can again buy from the first place - W1 SMA200  
Notice that you should pick stocks on which you have at least an 80-200% target if the price goes back to the MAX(200).  
3. Invest 1 pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line

  
4. Invest the 1  pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line

  
5. Invest 2 piles when the price goes under the W1 MIN(200) as far as it is to the MAX(200) from the W1 MIN(200)

  
6. Hold 1/2 of the position in profit until you are happy with the profit (up to you, I recommend at least 3 years more after crossing W1 MAX(200) upwards).   


  
This strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!  
If you stopped liking the stock you invested in fundamentally after you invested, just go with it and try to take profit when the price bounces from one of your buy orders and overall you did profit from the stock.

  
This is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:  
a) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on mediocre stock (TDOC) and 5-10 years on trusted stock (MSFT, AAPL).  
b) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have the balls to ignore them  


c) with this strategy you will rarely get fully out of cash - this may be hard to stand.  
This should be used on assets that are growing forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).  
I really advise buying something that is traded publicly for at least 5 years.

My concern that AAPL will not maintain its current valuation/stock price is twofold. First, eroding consumer discretionary income will likely lead to longer upgrade cycles, which means eroding revenue. It's also questionable how hard inflation will affect them, as there is a limit to what an average consumer will pay for a phone upgrade (especially now that their phones are nearing, and exceeding, the $1k mark) in the context of ever-smaller improvements in performance and functionality.

Second, this market has shown that it will punish companies that don't absolutely blow out expectations. FB is a great example of this. Even though they reported quite a lot of growth, it was short of expectations, and their share price practically cratered.",2022-04-07 21:40:40,2022-04-07,0.6808

i.e. Bought 100 AAPL in January, sold a weekly in December, AAPL remains a short term holding for another year.

456,"In my Google spreadsheet where I tracked my investments, I keep a ""Goal %"" column, and I had shifted SOFI to 0% actually about 2 months back--the losses weren't as bad then, though. I was slowly losing faith in the fin-tech sector--it felt incredibly competitive, and SOFI's moat seemed weak to me: an app where you can do several types of financial procedures? I couldn't keep up with all the other fintechs and how they related to each other, and I didn't really care to learn about it. PYPL was my other 'major' loser.

There were some danger signals as well: constant pushing back on the student debt by the Biden administration, money spent on a football stadium. And I did not get the hype of the banking charter. I understood it would allow for a better spread on loans, but at the end of the day, was its goal just to become another bank? Can't the big banks do what SOFI does?

I added SOFI when I just started investing because I read a bunch of Seeking Alpha articles and bought into the hype without understanding the company. Since then (June 2021), I've taken the time and read about Bogleheads (e.g., I read the Boglehead's Guide to Investing, watched Ben Felix, etc.). I also took the time to learn about the kind of companies that I actually wanted to invest in.

This gave me two goals:
1. Increase weight of index funds (which I'm doing)
2. Concentrate in the companies I'm most bullish on. For me, this is AAPL/MSFT/LOW/TGT/WM/V/AMD/MA/WMT/INTC/JPM/SBUX and similar companies. 

I still have some speculative picks--APPS is a big one, I have about 2% of my portfolio in it at 44 cost basis, and I'm pretty happy with it. [But I despise the business of ad tech...] It at least is profitable and I see a bull case.

In summary: I lost interest in the thesis of SOFI the last 2 months back, increased my desire to emphasize index funds and a smaller set of individual companies I better understood, reduce total 'speculative' amount in my portfolio. The recent share performance was a nail in the coffin--I won't pretend it had no impact on me. My cost basis was around 14.",2022-04-07 18:07:02,2022-04-07,0.9807

I will just say it was a very expensive lesson and it took me 7 years to get back where I was. Lessons I wish I knew before hand:
1. Buy low sell high
2. Hold for long term
3. Look at investments with dividends to pay as you hold.
4. Capital gain taxes are when you sell a stock that you held less than 1 year. Capital gain taxes are nearly 50%. This is why day trading/short term trading is not worth it

57,"&gt; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) gained market share in smartphones during the second-quarter, even as smartphone sales slipped 9% year-over-year, Canalys said on Monday.
&gt; 
&gt; The research firm said Apple (AAPL) had 17% of the market at the end of the period, partially due to demand for the iPhone 13. Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF) held the top spot and ended the period with 21% of the smartphone market, compared to 18% in the second-quarter of 2021.
&gt; 
&gt; The gains for Apple (AAPL) and Samsung (OTCPK:SSNLF) came at the expense of other handset makers, as Xiaomi, OPPO and vivo continued to lose share in China. At the end of the period, the three companies had 14%, 10% and 9% of the market, compared to 17%, 11% and 10% in the year-ago period.

In 2013 I started buying TSLA after a test drive and felt it was the future. In 2017 I bought some bitcoins after it was in the news and learned some more about it. Ride it up and done since. In 2019, we took a 401k from an old job that we had been saving for 10 years and bought a lot more TSLA. Had no idea it would become a $1T company but they checked so many mega trend boxes. Since Covid work from home I learned a little more about options. In late 2020, I bought $6,900 worth of GME options and after some trades, sold it for $1.2m profit about 4 weeks later during the January runup. When TSLA hit a high around the same time, I sold some covered calls that made a another ~$400k after I covered during the summer 2021 lows.

AAPL didn't pay dividends until 2012.

I've been considering adding one or two of the following to my portfolio, Visa or maybe SQ, JPM or Citigroup, ADBE, TGT (I think its issues are short term and believe in the retailer, I prefer it to it's competitors), I was also considering U, but it's just got some tough competition out there while it's still not all that profitable of a company, Im also pretty reluctant to having faith in the future of the ""metaverse"". If BABA drops back down it might be at a tempting valuation for me, it has more free cash flow than Amazon at least, but I'm reluctant to investing in a Chinese company when the fate of China's stringent COVID policies is still uncertain. I feel similarly about NIO as well, I keep trying to convince myself that I need an EV company in my portfolio.",2022-07-12 16:42:24,2022-07-12,0.8704

I say this because people who have boats and motor homes who travel around the country are paying the same or more because of Gas. They are giving out great rates for guests and starting to pack up. The people who did do more vacationing before the gas hike, are now looking at hitting the Caribbean for the same price or cheaper. Just something I would say to look at as a long-term hold. Something to throw $1-$3k, depending on how to feel about your own analysis.

130,"Just my 2 cents on your picks:

AAPL: Why does Apple deserve to be higher than $147 or a 2.4T market cap? Considering that the company was only expected to grow in the single digits beforehand, and that the MU guidance pointed towards a weakness in sales, why do you think the company deserves to trade at $176 or a market cap of roughly 2.9T by the end of the year?

DIS: I'm a believer in DIS, but it being down 40% is entirely meaningless. Disney was ridiculoulsy overvalued, and it's still trading rich if we take recent numbers - that's because it already trades on the expectations that future numbers will be anywhere near what numbers before the pandemic were.

WFC: Wells Fargo is also playing big in the mortgage space. With a difficult housing market and expectations for an elevated number of defaults, they may well face a difficult time in the short-term at least.

SONY: Haven't looked into it nearly enough, but again, why does it not deserve the current price? Why should it trade higher?",2022-07-11 08:06:43,2022-07-11,0.2431
131,"Netflix. It‚Äôs a bargain right now. The economy will tank by the end of the year and people will flood back to their Netflix accounts. It provides the most content and best streaming technologies by truly having better streaming tech and paying for Internet backbone to ensure fast reliable access to data carriers. Being able to effectively compress and then decompress the data makes the end result so much better than other services. 

When things get bad in the economy, people stay home and watch TV. It‚Äôs just that real. They don‚Äôt go out to restaurants, they stop buying crap, they eat cheaper, and they stick with what they know. 

I think Netflix doubles in value over the next eighteen months. Sure there is battle for streaming dollars but when people are home with.nothing to do, Netflix provides the most content for the least overall cost for value. 

The PE shows it‚Äôs a steal at current prices and if you bought and held the company five years ago it‚Äôs worth the same now as five years ago. All due to six bad months? It doesn‚Äôt add up. Sure people could move on from Netflix entirely but that‚Äôs a doubtful thing they will do. Netflix will come back full force with better more engaging shows because they have to. Is Squid Games 2 going to be on Hulu all the sudden? And there are literally hundreds of shows that are that good and addictive on the others. 

Disney seems like a good buy if we weren‚Äôt heading full force into a Great Depression of the 2020s. I mean their streaming is great and their PE is way off due to the pandemic making their parks/movies and other revenue streams suffer. If people don‚Äôt go to Disney parks, it may be a long game play. 

My real knowledge is in technology equities. I would avoid most of them like the plague right now. Look at the real value of companies like Tesla. They‚Äôre overpriced. And now that people are getting other choices of EVs, they‚Äôre going with traditional car manufacturers that can actually build cars. Tesla has promised the moon to people with their autonomous driving features and Cybertruck. They‚Äôre late to ship or don‚Äôt ship at all on most features. To me Tesla would have been best bought by Apple for the battery technology and manufacturing capabilities when Tesla market cap was around $65B. Now it‚Äôs insanely overpriced. 

Apple has been using their sticky products for years to get people to buy into its ecosystem. But the greed of Tim Cook and their failures to innovate anything truly new class defining, will ensure their long-run game plan doesn‚Äôt pan out. As governments around the world slam the door on their monopolistic attitudes, AAPL will not rise in value for a long time. My expectation would be until they hire back key tech talent that bring user experience back into the mix. Tim Cook only worries about the stock price so his $100m in annual vesting free stock is his. He is doing nothing for the company in terms of creating real value. The software with great sticky features is great but the company needs to spend a year or two and just fix all the bugs. It‚Äôs truly in bad shape. The hardware is top-notch but they went backwards in technology to provide people what they wanted in inferior ports. So people didn‚Äôt need dongles when they didn‚Äôt need them to begin with they just needed the right cable. A lot of misunderstanding. In the West, people use iMessages but in the rest of the world it‚Äôs WhatsApp, Line, WeChat, and worse because those companies are truly tracking the users every move. But Apple doesn‚Äôt take advantage of explaining to users in the rest of the world what iMessages can do. So that‚Äôs to say Apple Marketing sucks!

There‚Äôs a greedy CEO who cannot deliver new technologies as he doesn‚Äôt understand technology. There‚Äôs a drain of company resources on things that don‚Äôt matter and too much stock is being given to Tim Cook and the other executives annually. It‚Äôs truly a place where only the top executives take all the money out of the place by exchanging long-term valuation of the company for short-term gains. 

I love Apple products and Steve Jobs was a visionary. Tim Cook got rid of the visionary that was left after Steve passed away. Scott Forstall was the one who was supposed to take over once he realized and learned the role of CEO. Cool fired him because he was a threat to Cook. He was Steve‚Äôs chosen long-term successor to Steve after a few years of Tim Cook teaching Forstall the ropes of CEO. With that loss, I believe Apple‚Äôs talent level has continually dropped. Former employees want to go work for companies doing more for those other than just the top 20 executives. 

Nvidia seems like a good buy to me. I think Nvidia is missing out on its real value. It sells these products too cheaply and we know this as people buy them and sell them on secondary markets for triple or more the cost. Nvidia needs a CEO who understands the value of the technology they‚Äôre creating. If they can do that, they will be a winner and anyone who owns them will be too. 

AMD is a real force and a good solid buy. They‚Äôre really challenging on all fronts of technology. They can create literally all the components needed for most tech products. I would like to see them make a push into new sectors and put all their technologies together to create class defining products. They can beat Intel and maybe even Nvidia if they just capitalize on their technologies. Long-term buy for sure. 

The big problem in the whole market right now is what actually works when the economy fails or what will lose the least amount of money for investors. We have to look at gold as a backbone for the dollar. Beyond that, it‚Äôs going to be medical services, food source providers, energy providers, health insurance, and I think military contractors. The whole world is sending resources to Ukraine. This will lead to a resurgence of NATO and real 2% required GDP spending by all NATO nations on military technologies and infrastructure.

145,"Time-Value of Money.

Bear with me a moment because this does work but let's say you sold an option for 20% of your capital value which we will name as $10k for ease. So you get $2k and you may or may not get assigned. Whether you get assigned or not you've made 2k. You can take this 2k and turn it around and do the same thing so that's another 400.

In one day you can make, whether assigned or not at the end, $2,400 and $400 is liquid.

Now, what you can do with the $400 is place it in your favorite long dividend-bearing stock and go from there. Let's say this takes a month and you do get assigned but you chose well and are able to buy and sell at the same strike for the security because it moves within a range you're comfortable with.

You do it again, you sell the other side (calls or puts) for the 20% and get your $2,000 a gain and do the same with the $400. Without going on and on this produces a net generating return that allows immediate deployment into your dividend-bearing stock which rapidly increases the dividend which has significantly less risk in it and also can be used as you see fit whether that is to save money, to reinvest in the stock through drip, to pay bills and alleviate outflows, etc.

You've greatly compressed the earnings of a long-term play *and* that matters. A lot. If you could do this before many of today's hot button stocks took off, for instance let's say that all of your earnings you threw into AAPL (I know it wasn't dividend bearing at the time, but let's play pretend) you would have many, many more shares of AAPL versus using a single-income stream and theoretically your losses and gains on that portfolio as managed here is going to be covered by itself. The risk you're taking is going to be calculated with in a range and that range should be less than the total credit, if possible, by an equivalent spread.

Long-story short I trade both ways, and do make money long and the nice horizon is great, but there's a lot to be said about turning over assets quickly to be able to convert them into other assets. So people view this more or less as a series of get-quick-rich schemes and I view it more as a ""conserve capital"" scheme; in the case that you're not assigned for instance it costs you nothing to make the money and if you are assigned you built that in by how you chose to sell whether it be ITM on something you believe in or with an understanding of the risk of the spread and keeping it tight. 

There's a science to it but basically turning over assets into more assets (what people commonly call ""compounding"" which is not really what it is) quickly works better than slowly. That's it. It's just time. That's why HFT is smart.",2022-07-10 15:31:54,2022-07-10,0.9961

I know it's chic and hip to hate on the older generation but do you know how fucking dumb that is? That's like hating on Michael Jordan or Wayne Gretsky because they played the same game but in a different time.  And every successful investor or trader can have a different approach to the markets. Just like how you don't care about GME or RBLX, even more people don't care about GPRO.  So maybe you want to be a contrarian? But even if that's the case that doesn't mean going for shitty companies with shitty products. We are facing a massive existential crisis right now in the form of climate change, hence why TSLA the stock of all stocks went from 43 to 1243 in two years even though it most definitely isn't worth that price by any stretch of the imagination. But because the company is offering a solution which may literally give humans more time before we're completely fucked, institutions and retail rushed to buy this stock. On the other hand we have GRPO which makes..... fucking.... cameras?????? Who fucking cares. How is a camera going to add any value to anyone's lives when we all have cameras on our phones? AAPL which did 183 billion in REVENEUE in Q1 of this year makes a phone with a fuckin camera on it. Did I mention they did 183 bil in revenue in one quarter?  Sometimes, instead of asking the question ""why is x stock not worth more"" when the question should be what stocks are worth buying because of their intrinsic value in terms of necessity of their product in the future. That's how all the great plays have been made, based on future value. That's what people are betting on when they buy stocks anyways, and frankly dumbass cameras for redbull sports, skateboarders, divers etc. w/e was a fad that no one cares about anymore because now our phones are waterproof.

Anyway, my advice is that you learn about market mechanics as much as possible, study it, trade it with low amount of capital, learn how to short sell, learn how to hedge with options and you will become a good trader. Bad traders and good traders can predict the market the same - they can't. The difference between those is the execution.

161,"This is a joke?

Fine, put 40% of this in DNP for capital protection.

I don't know if you trade options but if you do then sell ATM cash-secured puts on AAPL or MSFT with 40% of the money since they will persist for the next 20 years and likely retail will collapse eventually under it's own weight in the future. MSFT is the safer of the two in my opinion because AAPL requires a very dedicated base whilst MSFT is literally in every country's business infrastructure in the world. Sell them long-dated (a literal year or more) rather than short-dated because you do *not* want to get assigned but it also works as an ""instant dividend"" since you collect premium and do so with little risk of assignment upfront.

With the proceeds give that to your parents for a vacation or put them into more stocks that bear some kind of dividend like O.

None of this is tax friendly but you don't need it; with the last 20% throw it in muni-bonds if you can. This will just grow quietly for them for a decade or something and is completely tax free in most cases.

Good for who knowing about chip design. The M1 is incredible, but the real reason why it is so great, is that Apple allowed a seamless experience between the architectures. Also Apple hired loads of people from those other companies. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Somehow it is almost twice as fast as my last years i7 with almost 3 times the better battery life and fans don't even turn on.

Because the software is optimized for it and it is a different architecture. The processor itself is not twice as fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;i absolutely can not wait for their AR/VR hardware and even car chips. Just imagine how much tech IP and leverage they have in chip designing now. I don't even think most people are valuing AAPL's silicon in their models.

In my Roth I only have index ETF‚Äôs. At first I was trying to time the market in it and found that I was using emotion and buying when the market turned green. This is always easier to do. I was acting like I was DCAing by buying very regularly regardless of what was happening, but I was buying more shares when it was a positive day and less when it was painful. This has meant that my cost basis is still higher than I‚Äôd like. Now I just buy a bit every paycheck and don‚Äôt care what happens. 

In my taxable account I have cut down to about 5 stocks that I have good long term conviction on. I‚Äôm down to about 10% cash reserves, which would be higher but I have been transferring a lot to my Roth to prioritize maxing it. 

The only way I‚Äôm trying to time the market now is by keeping track of a handful of companies that I would buy, with price targets set ahead of time, if the market really dips further. Basically to get these numbers I‚Äôm looking at the charts from back in 2020 so that I can avoid that 2021 bull run as much as possible. AAPL or TGT in the low $100s? AMD in the $50s? MCD below $200?

181,"Ok on further inspection you are correct about income reporting.  Previously only when dividends was paid to the parent and currency was converted was it considered repatriated.

But it also seems actually non-repatriating profits decreased significantly after TCJA removed the two-tier system which disincentivized repatriation.  Now they only pay tax on the foreign territory and just send it back if they want to.  The one time tax was for all the prior profit which many companies like AAPL took advantage of.  They ended up bringing everything back home (at that point in time).

So we should expect going forward much less of a disconnect between GNI and earnings from abroad.

I am saying use BOTH.  Sometimes aggregate data like GDP can serve as a useful reality check when things get out of whack.  Clearly going from 200% from 100% in a mere 6 years with covid ravaging the economy in between cannot be explained by anything we discussed here.  Earnings have their own issues as well, like I mentioned surging intangible assets / goodwill which can be manipulated or highly misleading of economic reality.

The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscient market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe).

190,"&gt;AAPL is a cult, tailored to the affluent, and many shareholders will never sell

I couldn't agree more, but a share price drop doesn't require the cultists to take note it only requires enough institutional investors to take note and divest of their shares, and my intuition is telling me that is likely on the way. And it's true that it pays a dividend, but not an especially good one or one that compensates for it's low earnings growth in my opinion.

&gt;plenty of companies are working on metaverses, and Meta‚Äôs will probably suck

I could go either way here. I can see Meta's Metaverse being a flop, but I can also see it being a success given their unique advantage of having the best-selling VR platform in addition to having the biggest social media network. But they are priced in such a way that their Metaverse play almost doesn't matter because their core business still has more growth potential than their recent earnings have suggested, in my opinion; it seems to me they got rug-pulled by Apple and now they have to retool their advertising platform to manage targeting better with less data, but as a software developer myself and with an understanding of the increasing expertise in AI that they have been acquiring to compete with Tik Tok this ought to give them an edge in optimizing advertising given time. Also from a completely anecdotal standpoint in the last few months Facebook and Instagram's Reels have been getting more and more competitive with Tik Tok, and I am reminded of the days that Snapchat was seen as a threat to Facebook's future and then Facebook ate their dinner.

&gt;AMZN has a PE of 51. It did great during Covid, and sales are shrinking. It has AWS, but MSFT has Azure, &amp; others as well.

AMZN is probably not a good short-term play for the reasons you've outlined, and I agree that a PE of 51 seems high given the earnings slump, but I think as a long term investment it has more growth potential than most other big tech companies and I think the slowdown is due to their investment in long-term prospects that will likely pay off over time. Factor in expected earnings growth rate of 45.4% annual growth and you get a PEG ratio of 1.1x, which is better than MSFT's PEG ratio of 2.2x or AAPL's PEG ratio of 6.2x. But you are probably right that right now is not the best time to buy given that AMZN is expected to slump more into 2023 before getting back to growth, so there will probably be a more ideal buying time than now in early-to-mid 2023.

Those are just my thoughts, anyhow. Will be interesting to see how it all plays out.",2022-07-04 12:37:05,2022-07-04,0.9953

193,"Oh god.

The thing is, all of these are extremely solid companies, and I have no doubt that they'll be higher in 5 years than they are today. That said, I'm not sure about all of them reaching the highs you bought them at. But it's good you got out of the extremely speculative hype-stocks, because these companies actually have a future and are here to stay, even if the age of explosive growth is behind most of them.

And index fund will give you a lot more safety to the downside for a smaller upside. It may well take several years to recoup the losses you made on these stocks as well. As for whether the index will do better and get there faster than your combination of these stocks, no one can tell you. Some of these stocks may have the upside of potentially getting there a lot faster. But on the other hand, I just cannot see NFLX reach 590 in the near future, or maybe ever, again.

So, think about your goals, think about when you need the money, think about your psyche as well. And that's a big part. No one can tell you which approach will perform better over the next 5, the next 10 years. One gives more safety than the others. So if you feel like it's weighing deep on your psyche now and you would feel much less affected if you had the money sit in an index fund where you don't see those kind of losses and will likely either only see minor red or green going forward, it is a valid option to rotate for that sake alone. But if you do, try to not look back. Try to not go ""I'm such an idiot, I should have stayed in GOOGL (which I think is likely to reclaim your cost basis the quickest btw) rather than going into the index"" in a few years if the choice you made turns out to be wrong. You couldn't have known beforehand.

Maybe start doing some work on these stocks to see just how far you think they're off.

Seeing how you got into them without doing any DD and have little idea where they're gonna go, I'd usually advocate for selling. That said, I think either choice is viable considering how solid companies most of them are. I do think NVDA and NFLX are the weakest out the bunch.

Also be aware of the size of these companies. MSFT at current prices is bordering a 2T market cap. That's insanely big. And it may be the best run company in the world imo, but at some point there will be a limit for how big they can get. And who knows where that limit is. But, you know, just to put it into perspective: The size of the french economy is slightly over $3T, the size of the german economy is just over $4T. So for MSFT to double it's stock price from here and essentially become a $4T market cap would mean that it would have size equal to the fourth largest economy in the world.

You think about how likely you think that is. I can't tell you either. Obviously the world's economies grow as well, but it feels like we shouldn't expect to see too many 5T+ companies. AAPL is a similar case. It reclaiming your cost basis would essentially mean that it would border on becoming a $3T market cap.

That said, the global GDP is expected to grow by almost 50% into 2027.

It also depends how big those positions are and what you plan going forward. If these positions make up 15% of your networth and you can easily put an equal or greater amount into the market over the next couple of years, I'd actually advocate for keeping them but starting to put money into an index fund and building it into your biggest position over time.",2022-07-04 07:01:15,2022-07-04,0.9841

196,"IMO there‚Äôs no point in over-exposing yourself to certain large cap US companies by both owning the stock and also owning an ETF that has a large holding of that company. You also own both VOO and VTI, which are 76% the same. Pick one. 

For example, MSFT+GOOGL+AAPL+TSLA is about 16% of VOO and something like 12% of VTI. If those 4 stocks also make up another 30% of your portfolio(I don‚Äôt know your specific portfolio makeup, but I‚Äôd reckon a lot of people tend to have the larger companies making up more of the portfolio), then you are heavily over exposed to any one of those 4 companies falling. 

Another example- The largest holding in any cap weighted fund tends to be AAPL: Say it‚Äôs 15% of my portfolio, and then 5% of voo and 4.5% of VTI. It‚Äôs now effectively like a quarter of your portfolio is just Apple. If Apple has a couple of terrible quarters, or someone invents the next widget that makes the iPhone go the way of the Blackberry, your whole portfolio is taking quite the hit even though you thought your ETF‚Äôs provided endless diversity. 

*Anyway*‚Ä¶ My own preference is to go much heavier on the ETF‚Äôs, VTI and VXUS for international exposure and even more diversity.

For example, AAPL's Price to Earnings is bigger than GOOGL (22.1x vs 19.2x), but GOOGL is forecasted to have an annual earnings growth of 14.2%, versus AAPL's forecasted 3.5% earning growth. Why would it make sense for AAPL to be priced in such a way that assumes it will grow faster than GOOGL when the data suggests it will grow much slower than GOOGL?

I agree that I wouldn't touch NTFX, but also META is objectively very undervalued (even though I'm not a fan of the company's ethics, people continue to use their platforms and ad revenue continues to grow despite temporary setbacks from Apple‚Äôs iOS App Tracking Transparency updates), and I have a hard time imagining that AMZN isn't going to continue being a major winner for the next 10 years given the dominance of AWS and their continued expansion into more and more verticals (e.g. Amazon Ads, Amazon Prime, more functionality for Amazon Web Services, etc).",2022-07-04 00:25:10,2022-07-04,0.9569

Bottomline, TSLA is very overvalued and has been getting the Musk genius premium for a long time now. But if Musk himself is the one whose reputation pumped up the stock, his loss of reputation will also deflate it, plus since Tesla is valued at three times the market cap of much bigger Toyota and has a PE more than 10x any other car makers, well, just do the math again.",2022-07-03 14:34:02,2022-07-03,0.4234

When the Metaverse comes out after Apple popularizes it greatly, I think the vision of Zuck comes through. He‚Äôs looking at the future and the long game. He‚Äôs done it before and I believe he‚Äôs smart enough to do it again. 

Netflix makes no sense how far they fell. It really doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. I mean with the loss of subscribers in Russia and Belarus, and a war going on. I think they rebound by Winter. People may need cheap entertainment soon. Netflix is cheaper now than five years ago. Some of the most highly talked about shows and movies are on Netflix. Sure they have some competition but one quarter of world chaos didn‚Äôt destroy them that badly. 

I like MFC from initial impressions but I haven‚Äôt seen their latest 10K. 

I like DIS. They basically lost two years of income from their parks being shutdown. So their P/E is way off. They rebound big time. 

AMD is a $250B company trading at half that. 

TSLA is way overvalued. Now that all the real car manufacturers start to introduce their EVs, Tesla is bound to hit a wall. Musk is a visionary, but the technology is in the batteries. He‚Äôs late to ship everything. Apple should have bought the company for the battery tech and license software co-developed by Apple and Tesla. But Apple‚Äôs CEO is too busy padding his pockets with stock options vesting to worry about anything he sees as risky. As an investor, AAPL has made me more money than any investment. As a user and lover of technology, I miss Steve Jobs and am annoyed that Tim Cook got rid of the real talent that was a threat to him in Scott Forstall. Then he gave too much power to Jon Ive as he knew Ive was no threat to his power. But in terms of long-term aspirations, Tim Cook‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs future is all based on if they can make the VR/AR worlds collide. Their car aspirations seem to be software driven. They‚Äôre looking at regulators all over the world taking stabs at their monopolistic ways. Tim Cook should have lowered the App Store fees years ago and shouldn‚Äôt be making such a fuss. 15% would probably have saved the company‚Äôs long range outlook on services. But let‚Äôs remember these services sell the hardware too. If Tim‚Äôs AAPL doesn‚Äôt deliver on innovation soon, the company will suffer a long slow demise as the iPhone is not going to be around forever. We‚Äôre less than ten years from a new tech that we don‚Äôt have to have our hands on to use it. 

I think Nvidia is missing an opportunity to charge more for its technologies which show real value on secondary markets.

If you knew when Putin would give up or a ceasefire will happen you could quadruple your money, but since we don't, and Putin might just be arrogant enough to keep attacking until he runs out of ammo, and then some, it is hard to predict.  However, I have a prediction.

Ukraine took a battering last month but just received some 280,000 missiles, killer drones and artillery shells from NATO. These they will use now with great efficiency. Meanwhile Russian manufacturing has ground to a halt, they cant make anything with microcircuitry in it and so likely they cannot rearm themselves, plus they are running out of willing soldiers.   So as Ukraine pounds back Russia for the next six weeks, we might see in September the beginning of the end.  Also Biden needs to bring down inflation and since Putin is the cause of 75% of the inflation, Biden as well as europe have a huge incentive to end the fighting by October, before winter and before the midterm elections. So if the fighting stops by october everyone wins. Putin just has to decide how to take an exit ramp, or maybe he gets whacked or deposed, whatever.

But assuming the Ukraine war will end sometime fairly soon, this is the time to be loading up on cheap stocks.  I would start with AAPL, then U pick em.",2022-07-02 17:55:51,2022-07-02,-0.9099

[Best Roth IRA Accounts for June 2022](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/buying-stocks/best-roth-ira/)

After the account is open link your bank account to it and transfer the $6000 annual limit (for you) in cash from your savings.

After the cash is in the fun begins. You can start investing it. If you went with a major brokerage you have thousands of individual stocks and ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds that hold baskets of stocks) to choose from, far more choices than are in a typical 401(k) plan. For a young person a good place to start is with an ETF that holds stocks that track the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 (S&amp;P 500) index, the 500 largest US companies, such as VOO, or a bigger basket of stocks that tracks a larger sample of the total stock market, like SCHB or VTI. For diversification you could add the ETF SCHD that owns less volatile companies that pay cash dividends. 

For fun you could buy 1 or 2 shares of companies that are familiar and you think have good prospects for continued success, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), or Alphabet (GOOGL).

You don't have to buy everything at once. You could invest say $1000 a month for the next 6 months.

I also focused on trading less stocks (been lightening since mid 2021) but more on timing 3X ETFs (did very well last year on this - caught two rebounds this year too). Individual stocks, even the ones you do DD on, are just risky in this market - I mean when AMZN, FB, NFLX dropped like a rock, what stock is safe? Yes MSFT and AAPL have been consistent performers but they fell too, and at their current size they're not gonna make you rich quick either. So I'd rather focus on stocks that I could see the sales (Luckin Coffee is the stock I talked about, I tap into volunteer network that checks sales in local shops in multiple cities, that's why I dare to put a significant part of my portfolio in it). Stocks that I don't put much money in, I don't need to do that much DD. I'd rather focus on few stocks but more on indices which are less manipulation, easier to time and much safer than individual stocks.

As for your thoughts on timing to get back - absolutely. I did catch a couple short term bounces this year but not convinced that we're seeing a bottom soon (wouldn't mind if so but it doesn't look like happening). Indeed it's difficult to time when to get back well, that's why I made it simple in the post and gave a 3 month delayed re-entry estimate in example. Also when things are turning, re-entry doesn't have to happen in one go either. A small DCA could happen then. I didn't want to make things complicated in my post but nothing is ruled out. No one can predict if one should reenter all in one go, or DCA 2 batches, 3 batches or 4... right now. Patience is a virtue.

Putting less in technology for obvious reasons.

I bought in November 2008 and within six months had an 80% profit.  Just anecdotal, but thinking about that shoud relieve some anxiety.  A half valium also works well, gg.

That is still my strategy, but on days like today you want to kick yourself.   So, if your stocks are high quality, they will recover after whatever the Putin inflation and recessionary sell-offs .  There will be some companies like in cryptos that may go to zero, but any blue chip stocks is going to probably regain the losses plus more over the next 1-2 years. So just wait.  and if you are being paid dividends, you get paid to wait.  All my stocks pay dividends.

I kept waiting for the market to go sour for the last several years, so I've accumulated some stuff I thought might not get a beatdown in a bad market, like BRK.B, UNH, a few retailers, etc.  Still, this year hasn't been kind to me what with being overweight in tech.  But over the course of 20 years, it happens.  I did buy more QQQ in May though, which turned out to be a good choice so far.  

Anyway, since you have no obligation to choose ""active"" or ""passive"", it's entirely possible to do things like ""relatively passive unless I see an opportunity"" or ""passive but overweight in tech"".  If I don't feel like there's an opportunity I'm ahead of the game on, then I'm free to let it sit in QQQ, VTI, VOO, whatever.  I'm not very disciplined in terms of following rules, mostly just experimenting, tracking against the S&amp;P 500, and trying to do better next time.  Timing is definitely the hard part of the equation.  

Yes, I think tech will continue to significantly outperform in the long term, but it's a much bumpier ride as this year has demonstrated.  And 2000.  My gut is telling me to throw money at tech around Nov 1, but I don't know exactly where, or even if I will.",2022-08-28 07:19:47,2022-08-28,0.9836

RTX $92
META $150
GOOGL $100

I agree that just selling it and moving on to the next hot speculative thing is a good way to continually ‚Äúbuy high, sell low‚Äù. But you could stop gambling and learn to start putting in the work to find good businesses that you think will grow long term. 

I started with meme stocks, lost money. I tried shady biotech stocks, lost money. Spacs? Right before that bubble popped.  Growth tech? Yep‚Ä¶I tried that right before that bubble popped too. 

With many of those trades I would be down 60-70% but I stopped my losses at 20%. Will some of them be good businesses? Absolutely. I think Disney will figure itself out long term(though I don‚Äôt like their fundamentals at the moment). BABA will probably survive any regulatory/China fears. I thought Shopify was a good business long term but I also didn‚Äôt understand evaluations when I bought it. 

 I tend to prefer not having down-trending stocks drag my portfolio down. Moving all of my remaining ‚Äúgambling pick‚Äù money in to AAPL was the best decision I made in 2021.

202,"QQQ in recent years (and SPY too for that matter) has benefited massively from the multiple expansion and the high growth rates of large cap tech stocks.

A big question going forward in regards to an investment in QQQ is whether companies with a large weighting in the index like AAPL can continue to outperform over the next decade. Personally I doubt it given their size and multiple, but you never know for sure. I guess it also depends on your benchmark too because QQQ may still outperform SPY just because it's a little higher beta and the same large-cap tech weighting issues exist in SPY too.

As for what's right for you that depends on your risk tolerance and investing knowledge. There are definitely safer investments you could make which would provide returns close to those of the QQQ.

Historically I believe small cap value stocks have provided some of the best returns over longer provides of time and given their relative undervaluation today I think that could be a place to consider.

But QQQ is fine. We're really talking about very marginal differences here and sometimes it makes sense just to keep things simple. Outside of a few stocks like BRK and V I personally would not invest in a few individual companies if holding long-term.

You should still be dcaing and buying your index fund every set period regardless of what the market is doing. Cause at the end of the day there is no right or wrong time to buy. However there IS a right and wrong time to buy individual stocks. You can overpay and underpay for companies and history has shown that.

Keeping cash on the side is not being dumb its just being responsible. Regardless of what the market does every week you should buy your index fund but always have cash on the side in case you see a pull back in individual stocks. 

Waiting for more attractive buying opportunities for individual companies is not timing the market. Timing the market is you not buying VOO because you think the broad market is going to go lower which is not something you should do. 

For example I own AAPL in my portfolio and I think its overvalued. Am I selling it? No. Am I buying more. No, cause it doesn‚Äôt fit my risk reward.

Every trade that you go into, you should have a really good idea of how much money you'd lose if everything went the wrong way. You need to have your stop loss set immediately after acquiring the stock. If they trade turns the wrong way, and you lose, you shouldn't be shocked or alarmed by how much you're losing on it.

Too many people buy stocks thinking about the profits they're going to make, and pretending that a loss is almost impossible. You'd be amazed at the number of people that literally don't even calculate the potential loss they might incur before buying the stock. They might calculate how much profit they'll be making if everything goes there way, but they spend zero time getting comfortable and familiar with the possible downside.

Before buying any stock, come to grips with a scenario in which the trade goes really bad, and you can loose money. Then figure out how much money you're willing to lose. 

I did a trade recently where I lost about $900 on the deal. It really sucked to lose that $900, but I knew that would be the exact amount I lost if I got stopped out. I got stopped out by a mere 3 cents. My stop loss was set to $14.42.  The stock ended up dropping to a low of $14.39 intraday. Had my stop loss been set to $14.38, I'd still be in the stock right now, and I'd be up like 5k on it.

Shit happens. You just have to recognize your risk/reward scenario. Never buy something just hoping for the best. You need to have an exit strategy if it all goes to hell in a handbasket.

Spy is actually rebalanced quarterly so they only rebalance 4 times a year. The reason it changes so much is because you can imagine an ETF like a portfolio. You may start of with 10% apple stock, but if AAPL outperforms the rest of the stocks in the portfolio, then apple will become a larger part of the portfolio and after a year or two AAPL is maybe 20% of your portfolio, even though you didn't change anything. This of course works in the other way too, if AAPL crashes -50% then it will be a signicantly less portion of your portfolio.

So the constant change is due to the change in stock prices changing the value of the given holdings, and this can be quite apparent if for example the tech sector has a very bullish week and the healthcare has a hugely bearish week.",2022-08-21 20:01:08,2022-08-21,0.4215

Also, many youtubers have complained about how distant and poorly YouTube (GOOGL) handles communication with their creators when it comes to demonetized videos. Although the same could be said for Twitch (AMZN) when it comes to streamer bans. 

So my reasoning is not based on numbers, ads, revenue, projections, growth etc. Purely anecdotal and biased.

I'd choose AAPL or NVDA between all of the tech giants. AAPL held up the best out of all the tech stocks during bear market and has had the best rebound too.

NVDA is doing well, they're still growing and have growth in revenue but they missed a projected earnings (they were too optimistic).

I bought 100 shares of AAPL for 16.375 in 1997, when you had to buy in eighths of a dollar. This was around the time they forced Microsoft to give them payments as part of the San Francisco Canyon Corp settlement, although we were told it was an investment. My dividends were reinvested but I sold most of them for part of a down payment on a house. I only have 11196 of the original shares instead of 11200 because the transfer agent charged me during the 2014 and 2020 split for the weird number that reinvested dividends gave me and took it out of my initial investment.

I bought 10 shares of AMZN in 1998 because I had ordered books from them and I liked it better than BookPool. I broke my rule and sold 10 shares around 2013 to ""play with the house's money."" So I only have 1000 shares now. I think that's about a 50-bagger.

I also bought Oxford Health Plans in 1999 when it was in distress, which was acquired in a stock deal by UnitedHealth in 2005 or so, which, not counting dividends, made it about a 150-bagger.

489,"Just read and you'll learn by the exposition you get on reddit. Selling puts means that if the stock goes under the strike, OP could buy the shares at a price that they like, if not, he'll just collect the premium.

If AAPL goes actually under the strike price, OP will then have bought shares that are at a loss, since the price went further down than the strike at which he got assigned the puts, hence OP'd be ""holding the bags"", so they could sell calls at a strike price, collecting premiums, or if the stock price goes above the strike of the calls, then they'll get assigned as it happened to them this time and they'll be forced to sell the shares. 

So basically as an example:  
P(rice) = 100  
OP sells puts at 70, premium = 1.   
Gains: 1$ of the premium, 0 shares  


P= 65, OP buys at 70, but the price is 65, so losing.   
Sells covered call strike price 90$, at 2$ premium.   
Gains: 3$ premiums of call and puts, -5$ of unrealised loss

P= 95, OP gets assigned, sell share at 90. missed a gain on 5$ if they held, but sold at +20$ of gains  
Total gains: 20$ stock appreciation, 1$ put premium, 2"" call premium. Total: +23$

This is false. The most deeply undervalued sectors right now -- energy &amp; financials -- pay the highest dividends because all the millennial &amp; GenZ bubble investors clinging to their still-inflated tech/growth stocks dreaming of massive bounces find dividend stocks boring (""boomer stocks""). Many of these stocks are paying more than 6% interest. 

This is the easiest time ever to make massive $$ in no-brainer plays.

Let me try to explain this with metaphors: The bubble investors who grew up in an era of the Fed put, and ever-expanding money supply, truly believes stocks always go up and they believe that if they park their money in tech/growth stocks like Apple, that more money will always await them at the end. The passive index investor bubble has very similar psychology. To those investors, these stocks and their index ETFs are the entire universe of investing that matters.

VIX futures are completely separate VIX spot, and are based on a completely different basket of options (albeit obviously correlated) than VIX spot. Using a rough example, this is like a 0 DTE put on AAPL vs a 100 DTE put on AAPL. Both based on the same underlying and affecting one another, but have completely different characteristics.

What drives VIX changes, both spot and futures, are a series of averaged, instantaneous bid-ask spreads. When markets are extremely volatile (like just before FOMC interest rate announcement), you might often see VIX spot ""freeze"" or not change for a bit.

Microsoft is slowly dying. They've underpaid their SWEs while hiring more and more incompetent PMs. They haven't shipped a decent product since the bill gates era. The only keeping them afloat is their moat and their sales team.

Meta ..I.. just no.

Netflix has maxed out its user base and can't really grow anymore. They're also losing users due to lack of content.

128,"The idea of a pivot is a strawman, of course the Fed isn't close to a pivot because a lot of inflation is sticky and employment is still high. However, it will be a good idea for both the Fed and the markets to either pause or slow increases to 50 bps and 25 bps instead of doing massive 75 bps shocks every other month to the economy. The entire notion of the hard landing for bears rests on the idea that the Fed will make a mistake and raise interest rates too much, so any news of a potential slowdown in rate increases is good for the market, like -10% in JOLTS, Case-Shiller rolling over, freight rates down -70%, etc. I don't see us having a recession if rates just stay around 4% for a couple years.

BTW, what ultimately matters to the stock market is really the present value of future earnings and the discount rate. If S&amp;P earnings are 220 next year (analysts have estimates of 242), a discount rate of 4% plus ERP of 3% puts forward P/E of 15, that's only 10% down from here. To me that means you DCA on every down day, unless you think the Fed will raise rates to over 5%, in which case P/E's will further compress to 13. Not to mention, forward P/E of non-top 10 (ex-TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, etc.) is actually much lower, at only about 13.5 (using analysts estimates). So are small caps (small cap 600) at around forward P/E of 11. That's literally at 2008 lows. To me that says DCA using IJR every time it's down. At these levels though, it's way too late and dangerous to be selling or shorting, since the small cap 600 is already pricing in a recession.",2022-10-06 16:35:03,2022-10-06,-0.4654

Stocks that are well off their highs will face resistance on the way back up from all the dip buyers who thought it could not go any lower. These sellers will take the opportunity to cut their losses or break even as the stock moves closer to their buy points.

Contrarily, stocks near or at new highs have no such potential resistance. They are the cream of the crop because despite the painful bear market, they remained relatively strong. An example in the semiconductor sector is ON. I would bet that ON will outperform AMD over the next year.

Energy: (we don't produce enough oil/fossil fuels to meet demand). Also uranium as nuclear is going to have to be brought online.

I don't know that I'd put it that way. I think that people shouldn't look at peak prices and determine whether something is attractive given the magnitude of decline. There are a lot of things that are 80-90% down from highs. There are probably a couple of things in that that have some potential to be decent/good businesses in a recovery, but in 2020, all of those names had potential appeal to people as people tried to buy anything considered remotely ""disruptive.""

There are a number of things that turned out to be pumpkins - the carriage from Cinderella that turned back into a pumpkin at midnight. Carvana was ""the new way to buy cars!"" Meanwhile, in a downturn like 2008, Carmax lost 72%. One can make any number of cases - there have been plenty - about Carvana, but at the end of the day, in a downturn it's still a business selling cars, whether it's selling cars at Carmax or in giant vending machines. Upstart was another one. The ""AI-based way to lend"" but even the S-1 admitted that the company's AI had limited experience with a downturn. All the sudden they're taking a number of loans onto their book. Stock is down 95% from about where that guy went on CNBC and acted like there was audio trouble when asked what they actually do. 

There are some bargains today, but this is a different environment and I think - despite the fact that there will be some real bounces at times - people have to treat it that way. 

That's definitely not to say no growth, but I still think that the sort of MSFT/GOOGL/AAPL/AMZN/NVDA portfolio that worked so well over the last decade (or especially the sort of hyper growth/disruptive portfolio that worked so well in 2020) is not going to be necessarily the place to be for a while going forward.

In this case your asking about buying a call option on a AAPL, so AAPL is the underlying asset and a call option is the type of derivatives contract you're buying.

Again, using a call option on AAPL as the example, it's possible under certain circumstances that AAPL (the underlying asset) could go up while the value of your contract (the call option) could go down.

As for why that is, well, this is what makes option pricing tricky and I can't explain that to you in a comment. It's something you need to read up then observe for yourself in the markets. But put simply you always pay a premium to buy a call (or put) option. What that premium is depends on various factors including the strike price, expected volatility and the expiry date.

202,"What I did personally was sell everything (except AAPL) earlier in the year at higher prices, and then begin repurchasing over the last weeks as we approached the 52-week lows. I didn't re-purchase every position though. I abandoned some companies lacking the fundamentals to withstand the inflation / recession / stagflation and put those back into other positions I thought were stronger for the new environment. I added more energy, utilities, staples, and commodities than I previously held, trimmed down the tech stocks to those with the widest [moats](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/economicmoat.asp), and added some income producing ETFs.

I'm using the SPDR sector ETFs to create my own allocation in indexes, and holding ETFs in green energy, EV and battery tech, and water, but my biggest single stock positions are still in tech (AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, ADBE, META, et al.) although I re-bought them all after their declines (to date). Other big positions by percent of portfolio are: FDX, CE, ALB, JPM, ALLY, MCK, GM, DIS, CARR, KR, KO, ACI. Also re-purchased recently after declines.

As the market continues the decline (crash, really), I do worry that I might not have restructured my portfolio enough. But I know that I managed to protect myself from 50%+ losses on many positions and reduced those losses (so far) to 3-5% instead.

If we get another bear market rally I may make further changes by exiting some positions and increasing my cash holdings again, since the bottom is starting to look even further away than I thought it was all year. I'm still betting long-term on certain tech: semiconductors, green energy, electric and autonomous vehicles, and water-related resources.

It's interesting to go through this transition because I built my whole portfolio starting in the early 2000s with small investments in tech companies like AAPL and CSCO. And it's disorienting to try and find footing now, knowing that everything I learned over those years no longer applies.",2022-09-29 18:54:10,2022-09-29,-0.4403
203,"I know you can never be certain on these things, but I think it's about as safe of a buy as you can possibly get at these levels. While their products are not as sexy as they once were in terms of DAU and traffic they're as popular than ever.

There are certainly questions about their long-term growth trajectory, but at the current valuation they're not priced for growth anyway. And even if you assume DAUs drop a bit over the next several years digital advertising is still a growing industry which should help provide a floor to any revenue declines.

I was also very sceptical of the metaverse to begin with but I've started to become more of a believer in Zucks vision as of late. I was trying out their Horizon Worlds game recently and I was quite surprised by how immersive the experience was. After a few minutes it really felt like I was hanging out with people in the real world. As the technology continues to improves I can see it taking off even if it always remains a niche compared to video and messaging apps.

Finally I think people just generally underestimate Zuck as an entrepreneur. Everyone likes to mock him because he's a bit odd, but I think that works in his favour because he seems to think differently than the other big tech CEOs. GOOG, MSFT and AMZN really like to chase each other for example. If one of those companies enters a space the other two will follow. AAPL is a bit of exception, they don't follow. They know what they're good at and they stick to that and execute perfectly. I'd argue META is similar. Zuck really knows what they're good at - Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Oculus - these are all great social products that have practically no competition from the other big tech players. He could be trying to start a cloud company and working on driverless vehicles, but he doesn't. That's because dude knows what he's doing and I'm sure even if their metaverse bet doesn't play out he'll find something interesting to spend their cash on which will revitalise investor interest.",2022-09-29 18:45:03,2022-09-29,0.993

The same doubts could be raised of stocks like AAPL if investors start to believe demand will be lower than expected for a couple of years and margins also take a hit. Again, were that to happen you could be underwater for years given the valuation.

Even outside of the mega cap and defensive names very few stocks are ""cheap"" in my opinion. I'd argue some software names which have taken a large hit like CRM or ADBE are fairly cheap at this point, but with FX and growth risks, who knows. A lot of growth stocks are very cheap, but then it's hard to own these if you believe there's a decent recession coming because you risk some of these names going to zero.

274,"The strength of the companies is not the problem.  The problem is our normal ""growth"" of the past 40 years has been reliant on a trend of lower and lower rates.  We finally hit 0 and can't really go any lower.  

Let's go down the list.

AAPL is going to be AAPL.  It's a beast and it's valued like a beast.  It's multiple is affected by how much money people have in index funds.  At current rates, it's more prudent for investors to shift into fixed income, and so AAPL's multiple will fall until the fed lowers rates.  

GOOG.  Ad spending is very consumer spending driven.  In a rising rate environment where consumers have less cash leftover to spend, ad revenue will take a hit.

AMZN.  Inflation + recession hits their retail division hard because the whole company has been built around a crazy high level of growth.  If their revenue drops their whole valuation thesis crumbles because they can't grow and don't deserve a 100 times multiple.

TSLA has the exact same problem.  If rates at 5%+ mean consumers can't afford to buy $60k cars as often then their growth thesis is out the window as is the valuation.  And economic growth and oil prices are correlated, so a major recession will drop oil demand and thus make gas cars more economical again.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of EV's, but the valuation needs to come in ALOT.

JPM could be at risk if the fed hikes until something breaks as some fear.  We are likely entering a negative period for RE prices which could turn into a downward reinforcing cycle.  

The rest of the companies are exposed to consumer spending and you can't expect consumer spending to increase in a rising rate environment.    


Sure there's alot of money on the sidelines, but the fed's job is to basically destroy that money by allowing valuations to come in.  Until the fed announces a pivot there's just no catalyst to push things up.",2022-09-28 05:06:32,2022-09-28,-0.9317

Industrial-type of companies carry a lot more debt, rely on steady global manufacturing/agricultural activity (and that can tank a lot more than say the use of Microsoft servers), and require expensive cap-ex. Moreover, they are more cyclical, so if we see a big recession, I would expect them to contract even more.

It's also self-perpetuating, when stock values go up, weaker currencies then have a harder time buying them.

This is a vicious spiral and will continual basically monthly until the Fed stops raising rates which will likely lead to domestic buying of risk-on, but strengthening of weaker currencies, thereby causing the same to occur in reverse.

305,"100%, companies that have strong fundamentals are being taken to the curb.  As far as I can tell people are selling off lower conviction plays first, whereas stronger conviction plays like AAPL and MSFT are mostly resistant, for now at least.

IMO people are getting shaky and don't want to be 100% invested, or at least want to pull some out just in case.  It has nothing to do with fundamentals.  It's a self-fulfilling prophecy where people think others are gonna sell so they sell first -   a classic run on the bank, but in this case, a run on the stock market.

The only reason high conviction plays don't get sold is because people still haven't reached a point where they feel like they need to sell their biggest winners.  This trend may reverse though, crashes always start in lower quality names and progress into la creme de la creme.  Not that every stock getting sold has bad fundamentals, it's just that people are more likely to sell a stock like Logitech before Apple.",2022-09-26 22:07:23,2022-09-26,0.9108

[Here's a blog post about it](https://moalquraishi.wordpress.com/2018/12/09/alphafold-casp13-what-just-happened/)

My favorite quote:

&gt; What is worse than academic groups getting scooped by DeepMind? The fact that the collective powers of Novartis, Pfizer, etc, with their hundreds of thousands (~million?) of employees, let an industrial lab that is a complete outsider to the field, with virtually no prior molecular sciences experience, come in and thoroughly beat them on a problem that is, quite frankly, of far greater importance to pharmaceuticals than it is to Alphabet. It is an indictment of the laughable ‚Äúbasic research‚Äù groups of these companies, which pay lip service to fundamental science but focus myopically on target-driven research that they managed to so badly embarrass themselves in this episode.

&gt; If you think I‚Äôm being overly dramatic, consider this counterfactual scenario. Take a problem proximal to tech companies‚Äô bottom line, e.g. image recognition or speech, and imagine that no tech company was investing research money into the problem. (IBM alone has been working on speech for decades.) Then imagine that a pharmaceutical company suddenly enters ImageNet and blows the competition out of the water, leaving the academics scratching their heads at what just happened and the tech companies almost unaware it even happened. Does this seem like a realistic scenario? Of course not. It would be absurd. That‚Äôs because tech companies have broad research agendas spanning the basic to the applied, while pharmas maintain anemic research groups on their seemingly ever continuing mission to downsize internal research labs while building up sales armies numbering in the tens of thousands of employees.",2022-09-21 20:29:27,2022-09-21,0.2903

There‚Äôs a web of manufacturing that I don‚Äôt care to unravel but it looks like yes TSMC does manufacture some of their GPUs. It also looks like they do some manufacturing in house in addition to other manufacturing agreements.

What I think you‚Äôre missing or perhaps misusing is the idea of moat here. You should be talking about competitive advantage.

You‚Äôre also interchangeably using CPU and GPU and those are two different things. NVDA as far as I‚Äôm aware does not make CPUs.

NVDA has by far the most advanced computer graphic, simulation/physics tools and programs the world has ever seen 

Go look at their omniverse (it should be called Omnitools but I digress). That is by far the best way to understand their competitive advantage because everyone else follows or uses their footsteps on these types of things.

431,"A couple things -

The reason PS5 and Xbox use Amd is a cost to performance tradeoff.  They have to keep the cost down for consoles to be affordable.

Server/Data Centers have 2 major cost - the hardware and the electricity.  Your comment that they can just use more,l ess efficient chips does hold up because of the electricity cost to run the chips AND cool the data center. Data Centers need the most efficient and powerful chips to keep the Electricity costs down.  The hardware is a one time cost.  The power cost is re-occurring and becomes a huge deal. If NVDA chips are so much better that you need 10 of their GPUs for a certain application but would need 15 that were less efficient/powerful that is 1.5x or more the power usage which is a re-occuring cost.

The other major item is that individual companies like Amazon, Google etc should NOT be developing their own chips unless it is a competitive advantage for their business and something they can monetize.  Let's say for a minute they could do it.  Once you account for the lower number of chips they would make and the ongoing support costs around new versions, code updates etc you will very quickly reach a point where making your own chips is more expensive per unit because you are spreading the R&amp;D across fewer units.

The other big issue with other companies trying to make their own chips is they will need someone like TSMC to make the chips.  TSMC is already producing at  full capacity so you would need to wait for more capacity to come online or pay a lot more to buy the capacity to support making your chips.

There are HUGE barriers to entry in the Semiconductor space especially if you make your own chips.  It takes tens of  billions and years to get a foundry up and running.

Aapl decided to make their own chips because they sell enough units to make it worth while because they are consumer facing products and have magnitudes more than a data center would have.",2022-09-21 00:44:46,2022-09-21,0.9838

&gt;As far as I can see, the only point in buying a stock is to sell it to someone else for more money later. Isn't this just a ponzi scheme?

No. First you have to understand what a Ponzi scheme is, and what stocks are.

&gt;**What Is a Ponzi Scheme?**  
&gt;  
&gt;A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam *promising high rates of return with little risk to investors.* A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam which generates returns for earlier investors with money taken from later investors. This is similar to a pyramid scheme in that both are based on using new investors' funds to pay the earlier backers.  
&gt;  
&gt;Both Ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes eventually bottom out when the flood of new investors dries up and there isn't enough money to go around. At that point, the schemes unravel.  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ponzischeme.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/ponzischeme.asp)

A Ponzi scheme takes money from new ""investors"" and uses it pay ""investors"" who are already in the scheme. It relies on more and more people joining the scheme to pay the increasing number of people already in the scheme. Eventually they run out of new ~~suckers~~ investors, and scheme collapses.

Stocks by contrast are an ownership stake in a business that produces goods and/or services. The goods and/or services are economic activity that produces value. Think of McDonalds (MCD). They make fast food that a lot of people like to eat. Think of Apple (AAPL). They make gadgets that a lot of people want to buy. Waste Management (WM) takes away people's garbage. 

If the products and/or services are popular with customers. the business brings in more revenue than the cost of producing the goods and/or services. That excess revenue above costs is profits. Profits can be used to expand the business, invest in research and development, buy other businesses, buy back their own stock, or pay directly to shareholders as dividends.

If a business is successful and profitable - or if it holds the potential for future profits - people want a piece of that action. They want to own shares of that stock. The shares are sold in the stock market and are subject to the laws of supply and demand. If the people who want to buy the stock can't find enough sellers who want to sell, the price of the stock will be bid up until more people want to sell, and the stock price goes up. 

If people don't think the company is going to be as successful in the future, or if they just need the money, they will sell their shares. If people who want to sell can't find enough buyers, the price will fall until more buyers appear because the stock is less expensive, and the stock price goes down.

If someone buys a stock - or anything else - and is able to sell it in the future for more than they paid for it, that doesn't make it a Ponzi scheme. It means something of actual value has increased in price due to supply and demand.",2022-11-26 22:50:24,2022-11-26,0.9526

So the question is what are you willing to pay now to get this steady state dividend(SSD) payout in the future? If the company is not at steady state, it should be growing, ie. the future SSD should be growing. If you've heard talking heads refer to tech companies as super long duration bonds, it's the same concept.

To make this point concrete, look at AAPL's past prices. Right before and after the 08 crises, it was at $3-5 a share. Were they in steady state? If not, what does their growth outlook and final steady state look like? Today AAPL most likely is **still** not in steady state, still growing, slower obv bc they are paying out $0.9 a share.

48,"&gt;You do understand what valuation models are correct?

Yea I've got an MBA from a top program and work on Wall Street. Assuming you fully understand modeling, then you must understand that the outputs of valuation models are based on the inputs of *assumptions*. Valuation models will be wrong*, it's a matter of how wrong.* FYI Buffett famously doesn't use valuation models or even a computer and he's doing alright. 

&gt;Do you think aapl deserves a 20 p/fcf in an environment where we‚Äôre heading into an earnings recession.

I do because the biggest company by market cap should trade at a premium. Since you think valuation models are so insightful do you have a valuation model to back up that it doesn't? I'm going to guess you don't and are being a hypocrite when you aren't actually building comprehensive valuation models to back up your numbers.

&gt; Mind you the fed has repeatedly said they are going to hold rates until the 2% target is reached and rate increases (like rate cuts) have a 6-9 month lag to trickle back into earnings.

This is incorrect. They never specifically said they'll hold rates when inflation gets down to 2%. Their mandate is to get inflation down to 2%. They'll hold rates way before 2% because *in your words* ""rate increases (like rate cuts) have a 6-9 month lag to trickle back into earnings.""

Any sensible argument  regarding the current market requires talking about inflation and the Fed response. The markets have clearly moved on every CPI report, FOMC meeting, and interest rate announcement/comment.

Imo Dow stocks, oil and DCAing into the S&amp;P500 is 2022's version of meme stock investing. I've been browsing this sub for years and I'm not sure I've ever seen people get so bullish on index investing and defensive stocks.

I'm not saying you're going to lose money or that what you're doing is wrong, but I honestly I think most of the returns over the next couple of years will come from a handful of unfairly beaten up names while the index is going to be weighed down by all the stuff trading at all time high multiples into a recession because ""it's defensive, bro"". Names like COST, JNJ, AAPL, etc.

77,"If it's in your IRA, you can pair it back without tax consequence. I personally think that TSLA is massively undervalued. Most of the Reddit people are looking at market cap as their metric. That is the equivalent of saying a Channel bag is overvalued because it's worth more than all other bags. It's demonstrates zero understanding of valuation. Even the latest analysis from Seeking Alpha (who rarely employs anyone that bothers to go into the K's and Q's instead of just mouthing a bunch of silliness from the data feeds) is taking their ""sell TSLA"" position because it won't be $4tr with just cars. What a dumb analysis for shorting a stock. 

I think the Street has largely moved toward technical analysis in its recommendations because it's cheaper for them to do so.  I've rarely seen an argument that actually is based on meaningful fundamental analysis. The only thing I see as causing pressure on the stock at current, is a need for the board to renegotiate the forward compensation package for Elon and Elon selling the stock himself to pay for TWTR overhang.  

Even if you slowed the growth rate by 1/2 it would be undervalued. Its battery biz finally showed massive revenue and earnings growth. Hence, as much as people hate on Cathy Wood, the two things she mentioned we'd start to see are happening, i.e. economy of scale on the core auto biz (both the selling of cars and fixing of cars) and the ancillary tech biz's becoming a part of earnings growth going forward. As far as the hater memes, they all want to use market cap, but if you recast the same memes with Profitability (operating margins, net margins, ROI, earnings yield) you'd get an incredibly different picture.  

Finally, it depends on how you buy stock. if you're really there for the early stages and you want hard core growth stocks in your book like TSLA early days, then it's likely a style change for you and that's also a good reason to swap out.

113,"&gt; It does not trade at 35x FCF if you calculate out their SBC. 55% of their operating cash flow came from Sharebased compensation. So you are playing 50x FCF not 35x times. Which given the current interest rates is a lot.

That's fair. All I can say is that I don't think it's expensive based on my models. But fair value is always relative.

At the end of the day the company is growing at 50% YoY which is around 2-4x what a typical FANG might grow at and most FANGs trade around 20-25x FCF. So even if we use your 50x FCF number it's still not expensive relatively speaking when adjusting for growth rates.

Look at it this way, would you rather own AAPL at ~20x FCF growing at around 5-10% YoY and buying back ~4% of their stock YoY, or CRWD at ~35x FCF growing at 50% YoY while diluting ~3% YoY? There's not a correct answer, but in my books that level dilution is almost irrelevant when you consider the growth.

&gt; SBC is increasinng, not coming down - also why would management cut SBC. It is literally in their interest to get more shares.

Increasing relative to what? It's declining as a percentage of shares outstanding.

Also it's not in managements interest to ""get more shares"" if those shares are declining in value. There's a reason why companies like AAPL buy back shares instead of issuing as many shares as possible - there isn't a free lunch here. What's right or wrong depends on the company's individual circumstances - which is something this sub (not saying you specifically) never seems to appreciate.

From a pure capital allocation perspective if $1 of CRWD stock is worth less than $1 cash then one could argue it's always better they compensate in stock instead of cash. Only when $1 of stock is worth $1 or more of cash should a company cut SBC and buy back shares. I think the math is more nuanced than this personally, but the point I'm trying to make here is that SBC isn't always good or bad - it's just a capital allocation tool companies have.

If you want to view each $1 of SBC as a $1 cash expense though I think in general that's an okay rule. I also find non-GAAP numbers that remove SBC deceptive because it's obviously an expense to share holders even if it isn't to the company balance sheet.

&gt; So that your stake gets diluted doesn't worry you? If they have this excessive SBC your stocks are worth less each year as your ownership gets diluted.

&gt; The S&amp;P on average returns about 10%. If your company trades at 42 PE, it needs to grow 20% for a decade to have the same return. However as you get diluted a lot,

It's one of the many risks for sure - and one I always watch. But like I say this is a risk fully within managements control so ""high SBC"" isn't a risk I personally give much weight to anyway.

It's like being bearish on a great company because it's over staffed. As far as problems go, that's a good problem to have because it's so easily solvable if it's having a negative impact on the company. The assumption that a company will remain over staffed or continue with excessive SBC at the determent of company performance assumes stupidity which generally isn't a good assumption to make.

Finally, their SBC isn't ""high"" when compared to other companies in their industry or when adjusting for growth. Diluting share holders by around 3% YoY when gross profits are up 60% YoY isn't something I worry about. Were profit margins to decline and growth to slow, then sure, it starts to become more of an issue. But this isn't the case currently.

&gt; No, because if their stock goes down - many people leave (as seen with Shopify). It creates wrong incentives to focus on the stock price.

I've seen this argument quite a lot recently and I think it's largely BS in the environment because where these employees going to go? Another tech company who's share price is down 40% and who has just announced a hiring freeze?

I think the incentives of SBC are generally good though, it's just this year has been an exception to that trend. For years it's been one of tools high growth tech companies have had to secure top talent without the cash expense. As a share holder I don't view this as bad, which again is why I don't view SBC as universally bad and just a tool which can be used in both in good or bad ways.

1. Downturns happen. You unfortunately picked a not great time to start investing and that sucks, but it's not a reason to abandon investing either.

2. ""my stocks (TSLA, GOOG, AAPL)""  IMO, people are going to have to look elsewhere in the future. You have a downturn and what at one point was 22% of the S and P? Mega cap tech. Everyone was on that side of the boat and if the dot com bust was any indication, there's going to be some further moves towards the other side of the boat in the future. See chart: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FhhfOvLX0AEnd_c?format=jpg&amp;name=small.  If this is going to be a repeat of post dot com, people are really going to have to stock pick in the years ahead and they won't just be able to rely on the same household tech names they did in the last decade. That's a bummer and not what anyone wants to hear, but imo people should entertain that possibility. There's too much buying the dip in growth as if it's still 2020. What if it's not? 

3. ""What would you tell me to do?"" Set up something that you can stick with and that you can tolerate the volatility of.  A mixture of *some* growth, some more boring/sturdy/slower growth and indexes. Maybe you allocate X% to indexes, X% to individual names and if you go through periods of not finding compelling individual ideas, more index allocation. 

4. ""My gut tells me to not buy back into this market until we are for sure out of the mess we are in (inflation wise)"" By the time it's all clear it's too late. No one can tell you when things get better, but the market will rebound in advance of that.

5. ""My ultimate goal is to build such a big portfolio that I can invest in just dividend ETFs and make a few hundred dollars a month"" Gotta build something sustainable (not sustainable in a green sense, sustainable in that you have a clear approach that you can stick with and that fits your risk tolerance so the next time there's a downturn it won't result in this much stress.)

6. "" Would it better to buy back into VOO, QQQ and put a note over my password binder ‚ÄúDo not sell anything until retirement!‚Äù"" It's not even a ""never sell"" thing, it's a matter of learning to tolerate volatility over time and also having a sense of your own risk tolerance and trying to turn that into a portfolio that fits you.

7. ""Part of me says buy up SDOW and SQQQ to make a profit off any economic downturn."" I'm not saying that things can't get worse, but you're a little late to start buying ultra short etfs. What happens if there was good news (lets say the Russia/Ukraine situation ended tomorrow - it won't, but lets say it did.)

187,"I think it's worth considering sectors at this point. The market is almost certainly going to bottom at some point in the next 6 months, but not all sectors will bottom at the same time.

My guess is that the drivers of this bear market will now start to meaningfully change. The short-end of the yield curve is suggesting that the primary issue going forward will be growth, not inflation / rate. This will be very different from the trend we saw most of this year where rate expectations kept going higher, but growth remained surprisingly strong outside of interest-rate sensitive sectors like home-builders and tech.

Imo multiple compression from higher rate expectation is very unlikely to be a big driver of further market declines, and instead the market is going to focus mostly on earnings and growth.

Companies with the most macro sensitivity are likely to be hit hardest going forward, while companies with the strongest secular growth trends should fair somewhat better.

I think going forward Dow stocks could come under more pressure than they've seen so far this year as the real economy slows. At the same time quality growth names should fair slightly better given the easy comps for software stocks and their historically low multiples. However, I think some large tech names like AAPL, GOOG and TSLA will not participate much given their macro sensitivity which could distort what's happening at the index level.

If you're looking to buy blue-chip companies I wouldn't get FOMO just yet. However I think most software stocks at this point have bottomed and will trend higher, in which case if you want to own these I'd be looking for entries here.",2022-11-11 16:56:46,2022-11-11,0.9927

To put what OP is saying in perspective here this is a company valued at $8b losing $1b a year. Worse still unlike some other unprofitable growth tech companies which raised cash when their stock price was soaring in 2021 U has no cash so they will be forced to either take on debt or issue shares.

I was fairly bullish on the company earlier this year, but that was when they were valued more favourably given them an opportunity to issue shares to cover costs, ideally while working on margins. Now their shares are worthless and their margins are only getting worse.

I'm guessing someone will acquire them if they get into real trouble though as their tech is great and used by a lot of developers and apps in the AR/VR space.

I'm a Canadian, and earn CAD. I currently have 80% of my portfolio in USD or US assets. Why? Because even though US equities are getting hammered, the strength of the USD has still preserved my buying power at home. For instance, if you're Japanese and bought US assets closer to the top, you probably don't care as much just because the JPY has been hammered more than the SPX. Given my country's reliance on real estate for so much of its wealth, I'm fairly bearish on my own nation's ability to be as economically resilient as the USA, and so feel comfortable owning assets that *aren't* CAD hedged.

Long-term, I feel comfortable in this because I can't think of any Canadian companies (besides the energy sector) that I'd want to be in simply because... well, how many big, Canadian firms can you name? Everyone knows GOOGL, AAPL, and the gang for a reason. I think the future of economic growth in the Western world will still be dominated by the US going forward.

Mark let his vanity and desire to be the face of the future, to get credit for the creation of next generation technology, get in the way and did more harm for the vision, the reality of what is coming.  He should have allowed the technology to speak for itself or at the very least have a new charismatic personality represent.

Every major player in this space sees clearly what VR/MR/AR will do for all industries.  I doubt Meta will ever deliver the absolute best hardware, but there is nothing wrong at all with them being in second place.  Also, Meta does one thing very well, besides their massive infrastructure underneath their social media network, and that is they know how to create software that empowers developers and content creators.  They may not be Unreal or Epic, but they can make the tooling and the content creation applications that enable content creators.  That is no small feat.  And IF they can get other major, premium hardware platforms to play along, like Apple, Sony, Vive, then they have a good chance of being a second place hardware provider and a third or fourth place software and services provider in the space.

I wouldn't put all my money on META right now.  I think AAPL has the best strategy and will deliver premium hardware.  After all, it may not be clear to all the naysayers, but Apple has invested far more in VR/MR/AR than Facebook.  The difference, the HUGE difference is that Apple has strategically monetized virtually every damn component of the stack along the way.  It's as if people can't really see it, they can't see the culmination of all of these things coming together.

So yeah, I'm DCA'ing a bit into every company in this space right now, and loving that so many don't see what is happening.

Back in 2013, $AAPL was at a P/E of 9. Then Carl Icahn got involved, and Tim Cook began returning Apple's huge cash pile to shareholders via buybacks and a new dividend. Buffett started buying a few years later. In the end, Apple's sales and earnings continued growing strongly, despite fears to the contrary. 

I think you can wait for something similar to happen here. Like Cook, Zuck won't give the market everything it wants, but he'll likely cede at least *some* ground on the capital allocation issue. We'll probably also see a prominent investor get involved within the next year or two. Icahn, David Einhorn, hell maybe even Buffett.

It's about the value of future cash flows vs present cash flows.
Look up how discount rate works in DCF for an example of how it plays into one of the more popular models for valuing tech companies (there are others but DCF is fairly dominant).

The very brief TLDR is that rises in interest rates heavily increase the rate at which future earnings are discounted. So if the bulk of a companies future cash flows exist far into the future it's valuation is more adversely affected.

This is why AAPL for instance has been incredibly robust during these rate hikes as its producing its gigantic amounts of FCF right now. Unlike say AMZN which is reinvesting everything.

That said I think you're missing a key difference between Tobacco stocks and Facebook. The tobacco industry HAS been in consistent decline for a while, especially in the US. A shrinking industry, combined with all the regulation in tobacco, means there's less competition, and not as much of a threat of new competitors popping up. This has allowed companies like MO to post terrific long term returns for investors despite the horrible environment for tobacco.

Social media is a completely different landscape. New competitors are popping up all the time, and some of them will eventually rise up to become a threat to Facebook, like what happened with TikTok.

487,"Not really. You sell the calls to collect the premiums. In a bear market, you have limited upside, so just sell calls with a higher strike price.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bear-market-could-make-income-strategy-even-more-profitable-2014-02-06](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bear-market-could-make-income-strategy-even-more-profitable-2014-02-06)

&gt;As an example of how covered calls can work, consider Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL ) . If you own 100 shares of AAPL, you can sell one call option. Each options contract covers 100 shares (although there are a few high-priced stocks that offer options covering only 10 shares, AAPL being one of them).  
&gt;  
&gt;With AAPL, you can sell an option with an expiration date in one month. Calls with an exercise price about 5% above the market price of the stock might be selling for about 0.75% of the stock's market price. For example, if AAPL were trading at $450, you could sell a call with an exercise price of $495 for about $3.40. Since each call is for 100 shares, your total income would be $340.  
&gt;  
&gt;If AAPL is trading below $495 when the call expires, you keep the $3.40 per share as income and you are free to sell another call. Doing this 12 times in a year could generate income of $40.80 a share if the price of AAPL remains relatively unchanged.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the price rises beyond $495, your shares will be called away at that price. If the price declines, the income would help preserve your capital and you would not endure the full effect of the loss.  
&gt;  
&gt;When the dividend is added to the options income, you could be enjoying income of more than 10% a year whether AAPL's price goes up or down.  
&gt;  
&gt;The price of the option, $3.40 in this example, is determined by a pricing model that considers a number of variables. The variable with the largest impact on the option's price is the volatility of the stock price. In a bear market, as volatility increases, we would expect to see the prices of options rise.",2022-10-25 16:10:06,2022-10-25,0.9628

494,"I joined reddit with the user name Borrow\_Spend for a reason... at the time rates were insanely and unsustainably low due to global market manipulation by central banks and equity prices were fueled by idiotic advisors spouting ""TINA"" and ""Cash is Trash"". 

The idea that somehow only cash is negatively impacted by inflation is ridiculous.  Everything priced in the same currency is exactly equally impacted by that currency's inflation or deflation. Period.  Do you think that your $140 in the bank somehow has a different buying power than the same $140 in a share of AAPL?  

Cash (as an investment class) is, was, and always will be nothing more than a zero duration fixed income instrument. The fixed income component of that has been worthless for a long time, but is now about to become meaningful again. The true and only value of cash is what it can buy.  In a truly inflationary environment,  capital assets go down and the buying power of your cash (in terms of what you can invest in) goes up. As an investment, cash goes up when inflation goes up. You are paid cash to hold cash to wait for better opportunities to extend your duration into longer fixed income instruments or other risk assets. 

Pundits tell you two things at the same time - ""your cash is trash"" and ""look to invest in companies with a lot of cash on their balance sheet and good free cash flow"".  Huh??? My cash is trash, their cash is awesome?  Someone needs to create the ""Cash Index"" that shows you how the investment power of your cash climbs as the market sinks.

25,"There are 2 parts to the pricing of an option, the intrinsic and the extrinsic value. The intrinsic is the portion where you can execute your option and sell it immediately to the market. The extrinsic is the part that constitutes the external values like time(theta), volatility(vega) etc.

The deeper you go the higher the ratio of intrinsic to extrinsic. When Nancy bought the $80 options, assuming the price of the call option is $70 and the price of $AAPL is $143. The extrinsic value of this option is 80+70-143=7. The intrinsic value is 70-7=63.

It has been a month since they bought the options and AAPL‚Äôs price is still at around 143. If Nancy had bought $150 options which constitutes wholly extrinsic value, she would be in the loss now as she‚Äôs losing a months of time value. Assuming linear decay(not the case), if the option costed $70 and is 12 months out, the option will now lose 1/12 of the value. The option will now cost 63. She‚Äôll be -6$ in loss now.

Since she bought the deep ITM option, only $7 of it constitutes to the extrinsic value. The value of the option is now 63+7*11/12=69.42. She‚Äôll be in negative $0.58.

I like tech stocks, but I can quickly name about 30 tech stocks that I have absolutely no interest in whatsoever. Yet, if I get an ETF, I'm getting all of those too.

I think ETF's are great for people that can't stomach their entire portfolio cratering 85 percent. If you're in an ETF and it's a disaster, you might be down 38 percent, but not 85 percent, and it helps them sleep better.

I'd rather have a basket of about 10 to 20 stocks that I'm truly ride or die with, and just roll with those puppies unless there's something fundamental that has changed. If it's just price going up and down, don't react. It's got to be something fundamental to their business, or it could be some sort of legal hurdle or something. I'm not saying never re-evaluate your positions and just stick with them regardless. If something fundamental has changed, then you clearly need to take a much closer look and maybe you need to walk away from that particular investment.

As for BRK, yeah, I'm not that hyped on BRK and I definitely wouldn't do what this guy is doing. I'd rather just own some AAPL individually, and in regards to diversification, I'd just have about 5 or 6 non tech stocks that I really love, mixed in with my tech stocks.

Personally, if I had 300k in cash to work with right now I would put maybe 20k in to TQQQ maximum, and a hefty chunk in to MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, FB (META) to sell calls on and gain dividends in the case of Microsoft and Apple.

That would be my feedback on a few of them. I do have opinions on many of the others as well, but that would be a start. Please note that cost basis matters. If your cost basis at CRSR is $35, it's a terrible, terrible holding. If it's $15, it's okay and may do alright. Likewise, if your cost basis on TSLA is $170, I'd actually say it's a good buy because even if it comes down to earth that should be a good base and net your above average returns.

VOOV should just be VOO and you can drop either XSVM or AVUV, neither of these are prominent ETFs that will get you anything more than what VOO would already get you.

You can also do a REIT if you want more conservative income based investments. 

Again, ICLN or QCLN - pick one. You don't need two seperate ETFs when they are tracking the same exact category. My personal pick for clean energy is ICLN. If you were to cross-compare the holdings of these ETFs you'd likely find a &gt;95% correlation.

44,"No, it would exist. Every stock's price would just change in unison (***assuming that every passive investment vehicle allocated capital the same way, and encompassed all stocks***). So that would mean, if one stock was green, every stock in existence would also be green, not a single one would be red, and vice versa. As to whether the whole market were green or red would be determined if there were more willing buyers of passive investments than sellers at that given price point at that given time.

But, keep in mind that assumption I emphasized above. Not all passive investment vehicles allocate capital the same way, ***and not all stocks have the same float***. Most ETFs allocate by market cap (e.g. *4% goes to AAPL vs 2% for smaller market cap stock*), so while it may seem like a decent assumption in this regards, few ETFs weight market cap the same (e.g. *some might allocate 10% APPL, 1% for others*). Combined with each stock having different floats, and most vehicles rebalance every so often, stocks wouldn't necessarily change in unison in practice, at least not to the same degree.

But, as the above poster mentioned, there would be no more sensible pricing mechanism. Markets would essentially buy/sell everything regardless of whether it merits investment. This is a problem with passive vehicles.

Actually, IMO markets are already too passive. Since most funds are weighted be market cap, and most people invest through these vehicles,  overpriced stuff get's disproportionately more investment, simply because it's overpriced. (And vice versa for the underpriced). I think it partly to blame for why entire sectors have reached ridiculous P/E ratios as of recent.

As to what happens when there are no more shares open for trading? No trading would happen until a price is met encouraging trade. Most passive investments behave as market orders. In the rare case between underlying stocks, the portfolio might rebalance in such conditions as necessary (money would go into other stocks open for trade instead).

I pissed away hundreds on bullshit, and I still have spending problems. And I know that robinhood was in trouble specifically for making stocks seem like a game, and that's the app where I've bought most of these. But...

1) Even at a loss, otherwise I was going to compulsively spend the money anyway. At least this way some is recoverable.

2) This is for practice and it's for long term. I don't mind waiting years and years for the market to lift all my bad choices up off the ground.

3) I know that many of these are essentially the same stocks or etfs. The whole thing follows vti/qqq/spy reasonably closely.

169,"Yeah, I was sloppy in language. The $612 billion a month is the rate at which people are feeling less wealthy.

You're raising a point I was not focusing on. An equity meltdown doesn't change the amount of money in circulation. Equities are 100% money supply neutral, even with fees, dividends, deposits and withdrawals, its's all shifting money around.

Just to make it clear an example: on the stock market. Say A has $0, B has $100 and C $150, in total $250 cash and there are no stocks. A buys AAPL at $0 at IPO, sells to $B at $100, $B sells to C at $150. A has now $100, B $150 and C $0, and C has the AAPL stock bought at $150. So $250 in cash, $150 in stock. So we went from $250 cash to $250 cash plus $150 in equity value.

Now you can replace stock with houses, paintings, whatever you like.

My main point is still the psychology effect: though no money is created, it's creating a feeling of wealth and influences the willingness to spent money and how they look at the future, the willingness to invest in businesses etc.

Thought via borrowing against stock (gains) money is actually indirectly created, I don't have statistics on that (Elon Musk for the Twitter deal, Softbank with its Alibaba stock). The easiest most visible one is retail margin. In April 2022 it was [$773 billion](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics).

That's of course not even 20% of the balance sheet money creation by the Fed since 2020 ([about $5000 billion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL)).

To be honest: this post started me thinking abut defaults. What happens there? I take out a loan of $100 (someone lends it to me). I spent the $100 and I don't pay it back (I default). The amount of money didn't change either. (thats 2008 in a nutshell).",2022-05-31 08:00:59,2022-05-31,0.9818

And now that its passed Jan 1st, 2022, you want to sell because its been over a year since you first bought AAPL shares putting you over the ""Long term"" holdings.

Well in that case only the first 50 would count as ""Long term"" if you sold all right now. The other 50 would have to wait for June 2nd, 2022 to gain ""long term"" benefits.

189,"&gt;are going to be worth more in 5 years

Tell me you don't understand without telling me you don't understand. Merely being worth ""more"" doesn't cut it. If you invest in individual stocks, you're gonna have to beat the market significantly. Over those 5 years, the benchmark is expected to return 40-60% in total. Since we're taking on significantly more risk by buying individual companies, we do of course want returns that make both the work we put into it and the additional risk we took on worth it, so an expected return of 61% vs 62% would not cut it. So let's say we shoot for 70%.

For NVDA, that would mean trading around $322. With a P/E that will likely have moderated a lot by then - let's say to 25, which still assumes that NVDA will have significant growth ahead by then - that would mean an EPS of almost $13.

Is that possible? Oh, entirely. Absolutely possible, no question. Is it likely? Eh. I don't think it's too unlikely, but estimates see it nowhere near. Looking at analyst estimates for the next years and assuming growth doesn't slow down, NVDA is expected to record an EPS approaching $10 in 5 years time. That with a P/E at a 25 multiple, which would be a reasonable multiple if growth doesn't slow down by then, would mean a share price of $250. This would represent an upside of around 32% over the next 5 years or a CAGR of 5.7%, which is below the expected return of the benchmark. So is it a sure thing? Absolutely fucking not.

&amp;#x200B;

AAPL would need to trade at a share price of $255 (meaning a market cap of more than 4.1 Trillion assuming outstanding shares stay the same) in 5 years. Assuming they stay at the the current, historically high P/E multiple (which is also high for the expected growth), expect EPS slightly above $10 for them as well. Expected EPS by extrapolation sits between $8 and $8.4, and that's assuming that growth doesn't just not slow down further after 2023, but that it rises to current levels again. 25x8.4 would mean a share price of $210, which would represent an upside of 40% over the next 5 years or a CAGR of around 7% and be roughly in line with expectations for the benchmark. That is, however, assuming that the multiple stays as historically high as it is right now. Multiple moderation could well eat up most of these gains.

Now of course, assumptions regarding earnings this far into the future get more inaccurate the further out you go. But I did not make any conservative assumptions here, and as you can see, the possibility of these companies underperforming the expected return of the benchmark is very real. They might well go on to outperform, but acting like this is a given and like they're easy picks that guarantee you outperformance right now is just ignorant and preposterous.",2022-05-30 17:46:31,2022-05-30,0.9952

There is no wizard determining the exact level corporate profits will tank this year and how to prepare for that, determining the number of cents a stock should lose. The wizard doesn't know how inflation, the recession or geopolitical events will unfold. 

""priced in"" is a phrase used as an anti-anxiety drug. It's literal translation would be ""we don't know what the fuck is going to happen but we for sure have already got it covered""

No, technically, we are not in the technical definition of a bear market becuase institutional investors stopped that from happening. They also made the rules to determine whether or not we are in a bear market.

We are. There is no way we aren't. We are in a bear rally at the moment. People won't see that until 6 months from now. Just like people will look back and realize we were in a recession right now and didn't know it.

I think AAPL and TSLA popping will signify we're on our way to the bottom. A crash isn't done until stupid retail money has been shaken out.

We're on the same page with the stats. I just didn't mention the growing consumer debt and subprime loans defaulting already (car loans are going to be a mess). I didn't mention mortgage layoffs, employment stops in construction growing, etc. etc. There is literally no good data right now.

As far as the next 18mths, goes. My thesis based on non-lagging indicators: short term bear rally right now - my best guess today is it will continue for a week or two. QT and Fed meeting will be sobering for the market. Definitely a downturn around then (probably a big buying fest pre-meeting as the market usually does).

But it will be the confirmation that we are in a recession (which will happen by July/August) and dismal earnings next quarter that will probably be the final nails in the coffin.

228,"Interesting phrasing. In my experience, very few companies only focus on short term versus long term. That said, industries goes through phases of extreme innovation and it's the degree to which the company wants to/desperately needs to shift to the new paradigm. It is also a function of whether they can or cannot given the amount of personal money the owners have and their control over their shares and their board. So like, something like BRK wouldn't blink twice if it had to make a significant change. (but he never changes, his model is far simpler, i.e. the beauty of BRK).

In the case of Meta and really all of the media stocks (PARA, DISCA, etc), all of them shifted sharply with significant losses that will last for multiple years. Other examples might be CTXS has been undergoing such a shift for years, EMN, DD, DOW, etc... there are loads of examples at any given moment of companies that are either going through the transition or those that are coming out of it. In these cases, the CEO was not as closely attached to the company, so they were booted out and a new management team was put in because the board was not into it.

With AAPL and GOOGL, their business model is a bit different from METAs. A lot different if we were fair to the two companies. This is why their financials are holding up a bit better than META's. IN both the case of AAPL &amp; GOOGL, the attack is not so much on their core biz and GOOGL in particular has done a pretty remarkable job diversifying out the concept of what core biz means to give themselves a strategic bene. MSFT would be the other great example of this. It shows pretty clearly when you look at the way they lay out their revenue streams, i.e. the % of revenues and net income each represents. I kinda think of it like a centipede. If you have to cut off, spin out, or other extricate 1 part, you could do it quickly. Similarly, if you look at how these guys lay out their financials, you'll see the part that is always going on for R&amp;D and the progress laid out pretty easily. I mean, it's not perfect, but it shows fairly cleanly. I think the company that does the best lay out of this within big cap tech is likely MSFT, though. You will want to look at both the 10k and the quarterly letters. This last quarter, all of them kinda did a revamp of how they show it, so look at both this year and last year for all of them (sorry... I know, it's a lot of work).

Meta doesn't quite have that. Most of its business have a lot more overlap in their trajectory. They are all media (possibly with the exception of Whatsapp, but really no). It really focuses on short format media. I agree with others who have made comments on the metaverse being an extension of where they are at.

AMZN has started to break out this way, but you can kinda tell they couldn't spin easily right this minute because the core retail business (the one that uses all the capital) is sucking the profitable pieces dry right now). Retail (approx 70% of rev) has to be fixed, management is saying with some visibility in Q3, but hopefully by Q4. It's a problem. So they are also in a similar boat (I might argue slightly worse boat), with different issues though. The last mile delivery got a lot more expensive very quickly due to inflation (labor, fuel, capex, etc). before they could finish it up and they've had to figure out how to manage pricing in the face of a rather different biz model from other retailers.

229,"All valid points, knowing what we know today.

I didn‚Äôt want to buy FSR, or any EV company, because I questioned the viability/profitability of an industry based on $50k-$120 vehicles getting 200-400miles per charge amid an aging electric infrastructure (70% built 25+ years ago). 

But it becomes more compelling if you look out 20 years and realize we can‚Äôt stop the disruption from happening, because‚Ä¶climate change. Vehicle prices will come down as battery power improves and all of the 17M vehicles sold annually will be electric powered. Tremendous capital funding will allocated to developing, improving (and protecting) our electric infrastruture. We may well be on the verge of a sea change similar to the 1880-1920 electrification of America, or the computerization/digitalization of the economy that began in the 1980s.

So, armed with that, which EV OEM do you buy based on first to achieve profitability (2024 est)? Tesla ($12.45), Rivian (-$3.25), Lordstown (-$0.05), Lucid (-$0.25), Canoo (-$0.75) or Fisker ($0.75). All of these, except FSR were wildly hyped and overvalued, and I am not a meme investor. 

FSR has industry veterans at the helm, a capital effective buy vs build operating model, and good looking vehicles, and I was willing to buy and hold this flyer just in case it turned out to be another AAPL.

lets say apple and tesla have same market cap so we can ignore weighting

and they both split to the point such that they perfectly have $1 EPS, their prices would then be $22 and $90

so if we assume theyre the same market cap then you get 90/22 shares of aapl for every share of tsla, so well call it 9/2.2 shares aapl and 1 share tsla for $180 and that would give you 9/2.2 + 1 of eps for your $180 = $5.09 earnings then your P/E is 180/5.09 = 35

similarly you could scale them to the same share price and say tesla is $90 again, but appl is also $90 but that means it gives $4.09 EPS and you end up with the same $5.09 earnings for $180 spent

this is a market cap weighted P/E

That means a lousy 2022 has been well priced in,  different stocks more than others.   So a company that can perform despite the headwinds we now face, or that comes anywhere close to what was expected, can rally.  

Look at AAPl for instance. It will have a relatively lousy quarter due to the China covid shutdowns, though its plants have remained somewhat functional throughout.  After Apple had a great last quarter, Cook warned to expect as much as a 8 billion shortfall this quarter.  AAPl dropped 10 points and is now 20+ points lower.   Yes, Europe will have a tough year and consumers may pull back to some extent, but still, how many people are going to sacrifice their iPhones when they cut their budget? Very few. The iPhone like healthy food, is a priority,  So AAPl is a discount buy now and the selling is overdone.

On the other hand, if you buy now expect to have to wait to make big gains.

300,"AAPL was a different company back when it was trading with a PE in the mid teens. Back then I was really conflicted whether I should invest and I didn't in the end because the moat and growth story wasn't clear to me. Back then iPhone sales were slowing and while people loved Apple's products there was no real lock in or moat. It wasn't clear to me (or other investors) if Apple was actually different or if they would just end up being the next Nokia, Motorola or Blackberry.

Today it's a lot harder for an iPhone user to switch to Android partly because of the software lock-ins but also because AAPL has now built an ecosystem of services and hardware around the iPhone. For example if you have an Apple watch, Airpods and backup everything to iCloud you're almost certainly going to buy an iPhone next year. I also think the iPhone has stood the test of time at this point and they have developed far more brand loyalty than say Nokia or Motorola ever did.

Another thing that's different about AAPL today is that they're far more diversified. For a start they get about a quarter of their revenue from services today which is higher margin and stickier than hardware sales. They also get a significant proportion of revenues from wearables, which when combined with the growth in services means that iPhone sales no longer make up the majority of AAPL's sales. Back when AAPL was trading with a PE in the mid teens a bad year for iPhone sales was a bad year for AAPL, but today they can make up for slower iPhone sales with other products and services.

Finally, investors in AAPL today no longer have to rely on continued top line growth because sometime in the late 2010s they started to redirect a huge amount of their cashflows into stock buybacks. While AAPL's growth isn't likely ever be as high as it's been in the past you're still likely to see robust growth in AAPL's share price going forward simply as a result of their large buyback programs.

I was quite critical of AAPL's valuation earlier in the year, but their earnings so far this year have been much better than I expected and their share price has come down considerably since then. Today if AAPL is trading with a PE under 25 I think you can feel pretty safe owning it. That said, given market conditions I suspect it might still have room left to fall. I own a small position here and should AAPL continue to fall I will be likely to add to it. It's not my favourite stock, it's a good stock if you're looking for a solid company that's likely to provide market-like returns for many years to come.",2022-05-23 23:22:30,2022-05-23,0.9856

Also fun fact, since 2020 M2 money supply has increased 20%, and SPY is now only 15% higher than the 2020 peak, further confirming the market is oversold. Big 5 stock is trading at cash and asset value while bringing in a profit which makes me want to buy a lot more but I don't have any cash left to buy.

Even worse, Musk has alienated most of his customer base and done so at a time of economic slowdown when large purchases like cars are declining sharply.

But if you think all tech stocks are oversold now just swap TSLA for a less risky stock, like AAPl or MSFT.  Because with a very high PE TSLA is still in bubble territory, and thanks to Musk and other factors, Tesla's growth era may be finished.

If Musk keeps going like he has the last month, TSLA could be in the 200's.  His recent tweets are terrible insults to his own customer base. TSLA makes cars for upscale liberal environmentalists.  And now Musk has joined Ellison in favor of trumpism and maybe even Putinism. His statement about democrats becoming the party of hate are absolutely false and absurd.  Lauren Boebert and Jim Jordan are cheering though.  Putin probably is too.  And his attacks on the US and California governments who he remains dependent on are also the height of stupidity.

All this started after TSLA went to 1200 and Musk realized he was the richest man in the world (then wisely sold 10%).  That is when I think the Howard Hughes sociopathic ""I can do or say anything I want and F you if you don't like it"" attitude really began.  You see an exodus of top people from Twitter and expect that from Tesla and spaceX next. Almost everyone Musk needs and depends on are liberals or moderates.   High tech geniuses are mostly liberals.  Plus the rightwing is against green energy.  And now a sex scandal, or two of them actually, having a threesome with Heard while she was married to Depp.  Ouch.

They make a lot of money in all these sectors despite not being directly involved.  for instance do you know Apple makes more money from games than anyone despite the fact they don't own a gaming division? Plus now they make the fastest most powerful chips.

I dont know if I got the lowest price of the year, but close to it, and six months later I cashed out with an 80% profit, paid off my debts then began a decade of buying AAPl on all sharp sell-offs and accumulating it, even going on margin three times to buy more.  Now that AAPl stock is worth 7 million and was worth over 8 million a few months ago, which I'm sure I will recoup if I just hold.  So my fortune is almost completely the cause of buying on severe selloffs and also picking the right longterm holding, AAPL, which remains the best IUMHOP because even a decade from now I bet everyone using IOS now is still using it plus maybe a billion others.

332,"AAPL is one of the least affected by rates since they have a AAA rating and can borrow for near nothing. They make billions every year already borrowing cheapo and buying higher rate corporate bonds.  They are like a bank in many ways, a very big bank.  Plus their cashflow even in a slowdown, is off the charts.  A billion paying subscribers to IOS and none of them are moving over to Android or windows.  They also have pricing power and expect the iPhones to be $100 more next year.  Not only that but if they want to stop buying back stock and takeover a few undervalued gem companies now they can do it. Apple's business also requires very little oil-gas or food and Tim Cook is first in line for the microchips and components Apple needs.

Once the China shutdown ends this could be a very exciting positive year for Apple. And if their AR headsets are ready, that is a whole new product category and the new Apple chips have the power to drive those babies.

As for China, they cooperate with Apple and do not bully them unlike other companies. During this China shutdown, only a few plants were kept running in quarantine mode with the help of the government, and so Apple will only lose a few weeks or production, not six weeks, then they can make up for it later. Plus they are up and running in India and gradually reducing reliance on China.   Chinese stocks I would stay away from since they ARE under Chinese government control, and would suffer from any anti Chinese tariffs or sanctions.

336,"Many of them don't, or they aren't near their implied move. This is what you are looking to find and it really isn't that hard if you just look at the days anticipated earnings.

You are also thinking about it wrong. You don't want to have calls or puts before earnings. Your goal is to have everyone else buy those calls or puts, because they are anticipating a large % move, so they are spending a lot more to buy the option, because of high IV. They don't get that large % move, or its not enough to really make their option move, so when the market opens they are now down 50-80 percent on their premium and most likely are just going to sell it. 

here is where you come in to make your money. You see these option premiums, you can see the price they are at now versus the price they were at yesterday, the day before, etc, so you now know the RANGE of these premiums. Buying them at this point that they are down so much is basically getting them at a discount, and you want to wait for a little volume to come in, but typically its an excellent way to take advantage of earnings without risking it on a gamble.


Heres an actual example, I can't find the historical options chart for AAPL but the day of their earnings their 160-165 calls were going for 1.70 a piece. IV on them was high but not insane. Apple had great earnings, stock was up 3-4% AH. Next morning it was up 1-3 percent pre-market and opened at 161.83 after closing at 163.79, so A LOT of call option holders were dumping those contracts. The low then went to 160.83 on the first 5-minute candle (calls are now seriously discounted despite great earnings and lots of buying pressure is now coming in) and THEN we saw the huge move to close that candle at 164.16 and the next 5-minute candle hits 164.84. there was another small dip after this and the chance to take those calls even higher but personally I have a problem of selling my entire position and not leaving some runners.",2022-05-22 18:54:23,2022-05-22,0.7276

341,"This is a really good post. Thanks for sharing.

I guess what I'll add to the discussion is that over the years I've become less of a believer in using DCF models as a primary means to value companies. What you tend to find is that DCF models make trash look really attractive and quality companies look uninvestable. It's why you see all the value investors on YouTube, etc saying don't buy companies like AAPL and MSFT while recommending people invest in companies like INTC, FB or BABA.

These days I like to use DCF models just to sanity check an investment. So for example you have a price target of around $275 on SHOP which I think is a little low, but either way it's not a million miles away from the current valuation.

At the same time SHOP is one of the most innovative companies in the ecommerce space and they're building themselves a significant moat with an ecosystem of products and services. I think a good argument can be made that SHOP deserve some kind of a premium. At the same time I think the mistake some value investors make is not significantly discounting stocks like INTC for the risk that they will continue to disappoint.

On top of that valuations largely depend on sentiment and broader macro environment. In 2020/2021 SHOP benefited massively from the positive investor sentiment towards ecommerce and the easy money macro environment we were in. Then in 2022 that completely flipped. In my opinion the valuation rerating of stocks like SHOP has less to do with the market seeing sense in regards to SHOP specifically and more to do with broader market sentiment and macro shifts. Whether a company like SHOP is going to do well over the next few years probably depends far more on the risk appetite in the broader market than it looking 10% over or undervalued on a DFC analysis. If the market starts to believe inflation has peaked and the long-term growth narrative of pandemic winners like SHOP is mostly intact we'll probably see SHOP move higher regardless of valuation as investors feel more comfortable putting money back into those kinds of companies. Similarly if inflation remains persistently high and the Fed gets even more hawkish then stocks like SHOP will continue to fall regardless of their valuations.",2022-05-22 15:08:28,2022-05-22,0.9944

Sitting on cash and waiting is also an option though all that does is stop you from losing, you do not gain and may be missing the bjuying  op of the decade.

The best stock is AAPL and is has dropped like everything else, now down around 25%.   I am holding a lot of AAPL longterm and dont need the cash for years so decided just to bite the bullet as all these sell-offs finally end and eventually correct back upwards, so long as the company you own is as profitable as AAPL.  I now I am considering buying m ore AAPL. Why  not?  What is the risk, 5 points?

AAPL should pop back, 10 points when China ends its shutdowns (any day now) and the entire market will recover (and oil prices will plummet) when Putin is finished bombarding Ukraine and that whole mess starts freversing itself.

In the meantime the war, the GOP ""blame it on Biden"" and their friends the gas gougers, and Fed will dampen the economy and make sure every company has a disappointing quarter or two or three. The Fed will stop raising rates once they have created a recession, which I think they have already done, with Putin's help.   So in the case of AAPL I think we are probably at or very near the low point, buying here for the longterm is smart, and very few people will do it. Inn fact more will sell at the bottom that will buy at the bottom.

BTW the reason I am rich is that I started buying AAPl at a time far worse than this, in November 2008. I think I paid $17 for AAPL shares then, sold them six months later for $35 and then re-bought and kept re-buying everytime there was a severe sell-off.

Cheap is relative. Just look at GOOGL balance sheets. And then look at boomer value stock balance sheets.

GOOGL has 140 billion cash at 1.4 trillion market cap. CASH, not stock holder equity which is even higher. Under 20 P/E. They could keep this P/E and take their price way up if they wanted by gutting a few growth projects that aren‚Äôt making money yet and keeping their higher margin businesses. 

MCD has a negative stock holder equity with debt (whatever being a real estate company means). With inflation, if their bottom line goes up, their earnings are gonna shrink. 24.6 PE makes total sense because it‚Äôs value stock? 

KO‚Äôs stockholder equity is 22 billion at 264 billion market cap. 25 PE. Are they really going to grow earnings in this environment? But value stock apparently. 

Take a look at AAPL‚Äôs balance sheet which is a fortress and their income statements. 

Yes, you can speculate that apple‚Äôs gonna stop selling phones and Google can‚Äôt make any money in a recession while people keep drinking sodas with their fries, which maybe right. 

But in a longer term frame which extends past a recession (however long that maybe), there doesn‚Äôt seem to be anything cheaper than tech stocks at the moment. Certainly not retail or low margin consumer goods companies.",2022-05-21 00:10:27,2022-05-21,0.4554

It made almost every mistake in the book except granting small companies a special form of capitalism. The rest is still as corrupt as it comes. And central planing is still very strong. They even increased it. They start to increase racist tendencies (we are the supreme race and the only one who can do civilization correctly.) Same as in Russia.

The biggest financial issue of the day in terms of macro markets analysis is, of course, inflation. And you do have a tech stock issue where cheap money + insane valuations and unrealistic growth expectations are getting exposed as mirage. Again, it's nowhere near as bad as before, as there are numerous tech companies that are profitable, well managed, and responsible. 

Another difference is access to information being far easier now than before. Anyone can plot  hypothetical growth of $1 starting in stock x and how much it would be worth now despite two and likely three recessions. If you can wither a storm for a year to a few years, you're still going to do better than if you didn't invest in stocks/indexes/mutual funds across the board. This wasn't easily accessible 10 years ago, let alone 20+. I think that changes peoples outlook on things. 

There are enormous ""value"" plays in everywhere from tech to consumer discretionary that also didn't exist in prior years. I mean, you could just own AAPL and the invest in index funds and do very well. Bargain hunting isn't as difficult as it used to be.

In 2008 specifically, there was supposed to be a 5-7 year wave of retirement from the generation that benefited from cheap money and aggressive but not insane real estate prices. Instead, people lost their retirement funds. Their homes. And had to continue to work 3-5 years past (minimum) when they planned on retiring. I can tell you that my in-laws retirement accounts, managed by a very competent financial advisor from a very large financial institution, took about 3 years to bounce back, 5 years to make money again, and they both retired in the summer of 2019. I saw with my own eyes an account lose millions overnight almost. It's very intense to see that and puts into perspective what it's like to truly lose everything. 

Finally, I think people are somewhat more calm because they are more liquid, less invested in the market, expecting less of the market (more skeptical of it), and have a longer time horizon against retirement. It also helps that the real estate bubble is now driven by supply/demand issues and less about cryptic financial engineering. 

I'm incredibly worried that overall returns for the market won't be as high for the next 5-10 years because of the high likelihood of interest rates increasing (more expensive debt financing makes it very difficult for capital heavy firms to focus on growth, especially in tech), sector concentration, and the eroding purchasing power of the middle class in America.

""An Example of a P/E Ratio Comparison Between Stocks
A quick look at P/E ratios for Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) illustrates the dangers of using only the P/E ratio to evaluate a company. In mid-December, 2018, Apple traded at $165.48 with a P/E ratio (TTM) of 13.89.

Ôªø
2
Ôªø On the same day, Amazon‚Äôs stock price was $1,591.91 with a P/E ratio of 89.19.
3
Ôªø
4
Ôªø One of the reasons Amazon‚Äôs P/E is so much higher than Apple's is that its efforts to expand aggressively on a wide scale have helped keep earnings somewhat suppressed and the P/E ratio high.

 The P/E ratio should be used with a variety of other analysis tools to analyze a stock.

If these two stocks were compared based on P/E alone, it would be impossible to make a reasonable evaluation. A low P/E ratio does not automatically mean a stock is undervalued. Similarly, a high P/E ratio does not necessarily mean a company is overvalued.""",2023-01-11 08:34:33,2023-01-11,-0.6597

37,"My thesis is that no, equities haven't been rotated out of, but also that they won't necessarily be anyway.  Here is why:

Last year, England's pension system became vulnerable to the leveraging of their very low bond rates.  You see the Ontario teacher's pension losses on FTX's implosion.  These are giant pensions, sovereign and union, that have to get real positive yield or negatively effect sovereign central bank balance sheets.

US equities, particularly AAPL, are looked at as safe-havens compared to even English Gilts at this point because every currency has become a dollar derivative.  International sovereigns and pensions do not have easy access to direct UST ownership.  Funds have exposure to prices not just yield, and to be brutally honest, yield is still below inflation on UST's for now.

So the big turning point for my thesis is if inflation gets down to the 4's and the FFR is 5+.  If that happens, the FFR will exceed inflation.  The thing is that I don't see the bond market responding they way you think it would because domestic pressure on bonds would rise driving the yield lower because prices would rise due to scarcity.  Which would basically blow up the bond market for the second time in 2 years.

What will actually be appealing to hold at that point would be bank stocks.  RRP rates already exceed treasuries and that profit is going to them.

1 - You need to get experience.  Find some trustworthy mentors who have a similar trading style as yourself. I can DM you who I follow if you like.  Search You Tube, talk to some financial advisors near where you live, read some articles, etc

I, personally, would buy XYLD and use the dividend to purchase additional shares each month.  It's dividend is currently at 13% (If I could go back and invest $50-$100 per check)

Next, I would learn how to sell covered calls, and paper trade stocks like TSLA, AAPL, META, GOOG.  In about a year or two you will have a good Idea on how the process works and how you can make money if the stock is going up, going down, or sideways. 

 I don't believe the stock market outpaces inflation and taxes, so my strategy may be very different than your thinking.

Here is some good advice I received, through various learning sources, over the past year:

\- Don't trust any advice or advisor.  Take in what they say, learn how to do a fundamental analysis of a company for it's future cash flow, and make your own decision.  You are the one taking all the risk

\- There isn't a big pool of money waiting for you to get your portion.  A very large number of companies will fail each year, and a large number of companies cannot outpace inflation and taxes.  learn how to be market neutral.

\- if you aren't willing to put in a lot of time understanding the market and companies, you will most likely fail.  May get lucky from time to time, but over the long term, doomed.  If you don't want to put in the time, stick to what makes you money and focus on that.  Learn to save, and find a financial advisor.",2023-01-08 00:17:07,2023-01-08,0.194

META I'm split on. I'm bullish on the Metaverse, I think the stock is undervalued, I think Zuck is a great CEO, and I don't think FB is anywhere near as dead as this sub believes it is, but I'm struggling with their Metaverse vision at the moment. I'm not convinced the leader in VR will be the company with the best VR tech. Imo it will be the company which makes the best VR content. If Zuck came out tomorrow and said META was going to spend billions on the making the best VR games, films and shows instead of spending billions on thing like eye-tracking then I'd buy the stock. But right now it's far too easy for a company like AAPL to come out with their own headset and destroy META on content. And with the Metaverse being such a central focus for the company that's a risk I don't want to take in addition to the FB user growth risk and the ad growth risk.

If share equity gets wiped out, the debt/equity ratio is going to end up very high, which to me says they're generating a lot of their growth and financing operations via debts.  In short, it feels too much like a house of cards to me, where it's being invested to as the world's savings account, rather than warranting the price it has by its own merits.

The main reason why AMZN is so unattractive in my system is that they have negative free cashflow. But here's the kicker - there are sometimes good reasons for not having free cashflow. AMZN invests a lot of their earning in their business, and ironically, AMZN is the only of the mega caps  that I currently have limit buy orders on. It is set at $65.

Ideally they should have been preserving cash and potentially even diluting shareholders at that time. Had they of done that they could now be aggressively supporting the stock price. Instead they wasted billions buying their overvalued stock in 2021.

\&gt; Also Buffet‚Äôs advice to Apple was to just buy the stock if Tim Cook thought the stock was undervalued. So Tim Cook did and continues to do so.

He probably said that because Tim Cook seems to be under the illusion that it's always undervalued. Buffett doesn't and I trust his judgement much more than Cook's. If that conservation happened it was probably because Buffett didn't want Tim Cook to be blindly buying the stock at any price.

To be charitable here though I think companies like AAPL treat their buybacks like dividends and that means there's a risk that reducing buybacks could be seen similarly to cutting dividends for some shareholders. Whether that's rational or not there is an argument to be made that their price insensitive buybacks allows the stock to trade at a premium because it's considered ""shareholder friendly"".",2023-01-01 18:22:55,2023-01-01,0.7606

Think about how Buffett invests in AAPL. He doesn't just put a portion of BRKs cashflows into AAPL every year regardless of price. He holds cash and waits for the right time to buy.

118,"Currently i do not invest in US market (actually there is small amount of money but i don't consider it for right now) but i can give examples (and i also thinking of investing in these sectors or companies)

For example i want invest in Chevron so i buy Chevron and also i want to invest in tech so i go by a basic choice like Apple or Microsoft or idk any tech company you like and then i want to invest in another sector in order to balance the risk it can be Car sector like Ford. So i buy 3 stocks if made the right choice (i know it's hard) most probably i am going to outperform the the S&amp;P. Also i will get dividends i can reinvest them.

But catch is it can lose it's value or it can stay at the same value. If it loses value and if there isn't a problem in the company-companies then i can add more stocks. If it's stay at same value it's also got cheaper because of inflation so again i will check the company if there isn't a problem then strategy stays same. 

Also stock number can be increased with money amount like 20k usd 2 individual company stocks 35k-3 50k-4. Also you can invest in a mixed way like %30 index %40 stocks %30 funds this is possible to.

Ok i've given you my strategy (actually it isn't mine i just tried to derive it from some basic strategies) since we are at the new years eve then let's look at some values for 2022. For example i am going to pretend like i bought Chevron, Apple, Ford these are some of the well known companies around the world it isn't some adventure one of it is has the 1 T market cap another ones founder had written the rules of industrial workforce management another one is a energy company that is older than 100 years. Let's pretend we i invested 100 dollars on each with total of 400 dollars. Lets look at 1 Y graph Ford : -52.41%, Chevron: +43.56%, Apple: -24.53%  Avg : -11.13%  so 300$ -&gt; 266.61

S&amp;P 500 case : -17.91%  so 300$ -&gt; 246.27 

Let's look for 5Y case S&amp;P 500 : +35.97%  so 
300$ -&gt; 407.91$
F: +6.02% , CVX: +43.19%, AAPL: +210.41% 
Avg: 86.54% so 300$ -&gt; 559.62$


Congrats you haven't make money this year but you actually outperformed S&amp;P 500 with not losing additional 6.78 $ for every 100 $ . In 5Y you actually outperformed the market if you say me that is 5Y is a long time i want to remind you that you aren't going to retire in 1Y. Also there are some ratios like P/E i look for i didn't even look to their ratios at 31 Dec 2021 those companies was the first ones that came to my mind to give examples you can find better companies. Maybe Exxonmobil was a better idea or General Motors or Microsoft there are 500 companies in S&amp;P 500 research them better, research the sector like when the Ukraine-Russian war started it was obvious that oil prices were going increase so you could invest in a company that produces Oil.

TLDR: Look for ratios, invest in 3-4 companies from individual sectors. If you want to say say S&amp;P 500 is better then why not we record the values of F, CVX, AAPL

I could be wrong about this, but I don't think the near-term ""killer app"" is in gaming or conferencing, but entertainment, which currently isn't a focus for Oculus at all. It's actually kind of surprising to me that the only industry to work this out so far has been the porn industry. At least outside of a few game studios, I'm not aware of any other industry actively investing in quality content for VR hardware.

What I really want to do with my Oculus is be in the room with my favourite celebs and favourite characters from TV shows. Or if it's possible experience a fully 3D film or TV series. For example, something like Avatar would be incredible in VR. Being able to look around the environment and perhaps even interact with it would be an amazing experience and one I'd happily pay for.

It's total speculation, but I think if AAPL enters this space, they might go in the experience direction rather than try to compete with META on the tech. If they create quality entertainment content for a low-cost headset they could create a whole new medium of entertainment. And other common use cases like fitness apps don't require the kind of expensive eye-tracking tech META are working on.

Unfortunately I think Zuck is probably too focused on the tech and not focused enough product. I suspect AAPL will be the first player in this space to demonstrate clearly why VR experiences are worth paying for.",2022-12-29 00:17:35,2022-12-29,0.986

177,"Well I'll start out by saying my opinion going into this year was unpopular and wrong so I have zero confidence in my ability to predict 2023. Going into 2022 I still believed strongly in the transitory inflation narrative and thought most of the rate concerns would have played out by the second quarter.

My view changed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and then continued to change after seeing consistently high inflation prints throughout the year. But at the risk of being wrong again I think that 2023 will likely see an end to the rate and inflation fears, but I think we'll see some panic before that happens.

I still believe that inflation will ultimately be proven transitory, but I massively underestimated how strong corporate and consumer balance sheets were going into 2022, which have so far seem to have provided a large buffer for higher rates. But in contrast to late 2021, we're now seeing record low personal savings rates and completely unaffordable mortgages globally, and this in my view will almost guarantee a sharp decline in house prices in 2023. I'm not predicting a GFC style panic, but there will be clear signs of distress across the economy as house prices fall given the size of the real estate market and its importance to consumer sentiment.

I think on the corporate side we're also going to see some blow-ups of over-leveraged companies in 2023. First that will be companies like PTON and CVNA, but slowly that's going to expand to a general concern for any leveraged company vulnerable to the consumer slowdown that's beginning to play out. Eventually one or two big players will look like they could be the verge of blowing up and this coupled with inflation clearly dropping rapidly will probably force a reluctant but minor pivot from the Fed in late Q2.

I think during this time the NASDAQ will fall slightly below pre-Covid levels fuelled primarily by concerns that AAPL ""is dead"" as consumers pull back on high cost items like MacBooks and iPhones. This narrative will be pushed by CNBC commenters who are literally brain dead, along with more idiotic claims that companies like AMZN, GOOG, TSLA and META are also ""dead"", ""dying"" or ""over-owned"".

By Q3 we'll clearly be in a recession and the Fed will be sounding much more dovish despite rates still being fairly high. I think despite the Fed starting to cut rates the market will struggle to rebound from fear of inflation returning and an opinion that the Fed isn't cutting aggressively enough to support the economy as the recession is deepening.

By Q4 Jim Cramer will be claiming that the economic situation is as bad as the GFC and that investors should be selling everything. From this point on he will only recommend the stocks of CEOs that go on Mad Money. This bearish sentiment will then be followed by a surprise Santa Clause rally at the end of the year which will be incorrectly be labelled a bear-market rally. As YoY inflation nears 2% the Fed will surprise everyone by cutting rates to zero in Jan / Feb of 2024 fuelling a decent recovery in tech, but still short of ATHs. Other areas of the market will stop declining, but see less of a rally.

To summarise, I tend to think interest rates will trend back down to post-GFC levels over the next couple of years and that the recession in 2023 will be look far more ugly by mid-2023 than people are currently expecting. But my guess is that we probably won't see a GFC style event, because I think central bankers will eventually be forced to pivot quite dramatically as inflation continues to fall. The market in 2023 will feel much worse than 2022, but will fall less from a percentage point perspective.",2022-12-28 17:04:15,2022-12-28,-0.9939

AAPL was $150, now it's $130.

Everyone is latching onto the Twitter deal as the sole cause but it's just a scapegoat. The real reason is varied and nuanced.

TSLA has the most active options market of any stock. Bears have been trying to short it forever. Bulls were probably over-leveraged on margin and options. The media puts Tesla and Elon under a microscope.

Because of all these things Tesla is and always has been extremely volatile. Every movement up or down is magnified.

I will say this though, since I started viewing the SPX as the U.S.'s capital account, things do make more logical sense.  The reason TSLA hasn't gone down more than it has (and likely should if traditional TA matters at all) is AAPL.  VOO and SPY and all other SPX derivative funds have not seen marked outflows to the level commiserate to what the Bond market has to say about liquidity.  TSLA is in the SPX.  AAPL is being used internationally as an inflation hedge and as a defensive domestically.  Ditto the other top 9% of the SPX weight (look at how it breaks down).  But not to the level of AAPL.

If I told you the SPX was a derivative of its top 5 companies and that they made up the vast majority of exposure of almost any investor in the stock market would you believe me?  If the SPX is the US capital account, then the derivatives are all just planets around the highest weighted corporate suns.

268,"If you think running datacenters (as a part of msft business) is cheap, think again.

Since the start of the trade war 4-5yrs ago, debt/equity ratio has been gradually going up for AAPL. Prior to the tradewar, MSFT always trails behind AAPL. Not anymore and the reason is quite simple. AAPL has 2 options, pay a higher price to continue to conduct their business in China or start the painful migration process that could take up maybe 5-10yrs from now perhaps to complete?

I think we can speculate and can assume that moving out of China is going to be very painful and will hit AAPL books hard. Nothing really change for MSFT, they don't have the problems that AAPL is facing so their debt/euquity pretty much stays the same as it was 4-5yrs ago.

For comparison, under Steve Jobs, Apple was printing shares every quarter, not buying them. Similarly, Jeff Bezos never did any buybacks at Amazon.

CFOs understand the impact of buybacks perfectly, that's the best way to boost compensation for the top management by artificially improving performance metrics and getting higher stock awards.

A lot of companies in S&amp;P 500 spent so much on stock buybacks that they eventually had their market cap being less than that. Look at Intel and Boeing for example. Or almost any airline company. For example, Intel spent $110.0 billion on buybacks and its current market cap is $107 billion and the company is drowning in debt and begging governments around the world for subsidies.

Previous CFOs enriched themselves through outsized stock buybacks, left those companies heavily indebted during a crisis, and are in no way responsible for the long-term consequences.

Apple is flying high today, as did Intel 20 years ago. But none are immune to mismanagement.",2022-12-23 06:54:09,2022-12-23,0.4285

272,"According to: https://ycharts.com/companies/AAPL/stock_buyback

Apple has bought back $227 Billion since the start of the pandemic. Current AAPL market cap is $2,104 Billion. So that's roughly 10% of the stock has been bought back. So instead of $82 a share pre-pandemic, that'd be about $90. Plus a solid 10% inflation, let's round to $100 a share.

But that $100 is for a low interest rate environment, and we are *not* in that environment anymore. I think a price target of $70-80 for AAPL over the next year or two is totally reasonable.",2022-12-23 05:42:33,2022-12-23,0.5927

276,"No, there are several major reasons for it to reach that price. For comparison let's look at some ratios between MSFT vs AAPL:

* liabilities/equity: 1.07 vs 5.96
* liabilities/assets: 0.51 vs 0.85
* equity/assets: 0.48 vs 0.14
* liabilities/ebitda: 0.6 vs 0.9

You can see these 4 important ratios, where MSFT absolutely **destroyed** AAPL but AAPL and MSFT both dropped about the same \~28% YTD, which isn't correct.

AAPL has a long way to drop from here to about $100/share to be fair. Whoever is running Microsoft finance department is literally GOD. The company is running so lean heading into a recession, just like they have a time machine at their disposal. Look at that beautiful 4th ratio above.

It‚Äôs still a 22.17 P/E but does it really deserve a P/E over 16?  With manufacturing moving away from China we‚Äôre going to see compressed profit margins in 2023-2024 along with weakening consumer demand.

A/R isn‚Äôt going to be as popular as the iPhone and I think the market is over estimating possible innovations that might end up being duds or products that fail to launch.

You are always valuing a stock based on things that don‚Äôt exist. Always. The future earnings don‚Äôt exist yet.

No, but I also can‚Äôt tell you the exact dollar amount that they will gross in iPhone sales next year. I can‚Äôt tell you what their EPS will be. But I can still buy or sell the stock based on what I expect those things to be. 

&gt; we can't which is why we have to stick to what we know

You *can‚Äôt* buy a stock based only on known knowns. You don‚Äôt even know if the company will exist next year. You are always forecasting revenue. The difference between looking at revenue for products they already sell versus revenue for products they don‚Äôt sell yet is that the potential for error is larger in the latter case, but in both cases you are estimating the future based on the past.",2022-12-22 22:31:52,2022-12-22,-0.7059

360,"&gt;Aapl has a 200 price target. That's all I know. It was 180 a months ago.

A price target of $200 by who and by when? ""Analysts"" who have been consistently wrong all along when it comes to price targets?  Is that all you know? Don't you know anything about what all has happened since that $180 shareprice from many months ago when interest rates were 0%? Multiple compression for instance? revenue? earnings? Productions costs?  AAPL's Valuation? 

&gt;Aapl will be 250 or above in 4 years.

That's just some guess... What's this prediction based on?  $250/shr  would give it a market cap of ~3.8 trillion and this excludes  dividend payments of ~$15 Billion every year  and ~$85 Billion in share repurchase this financial year alone. They have revenues of ~$400B and earnings of ~$100B....so even if multiples were to stay the same and not compress further when interest rates stay static without further hike, they would have to earn close to a trillion dollars in annual revenue to justify that share price. 


&gt;
&gt;Risk free is 4% not 5%.
&gt;

Only the US  federal govt. issued debt gets a triple AAA rating. The next best thing is AA. AAA  1 yr T-bills are at 4.6% and the FFR is still being raised though slower. You can get 1 year AA corporate bonds at 5+%. I just bought a Citi corp non callable 1 yr AA bond at 5.2% a few weeks ago. That's as good as risk free if you ask me. 


&gt; Also AAPL can buy back stock and has high margins

They bought back stock worth $85 billion this year alone and they lost a market cap of $1 trillion in that time while the shareprice is off 25% YTD.

397,"About a day or two ago I looked up the Fed's balance sheet and found that the QT isn't very much. The current amount is something like $8.5 Trillion. It was about $4T a few years ago just before the pandemic and quantitative easing during the pandemic brought it up to just under $9T about a year ago.

The past few months they have done more QT, but only about $100 billion per month. Yet inflation seems to be slowing and the factory orders and new orders of durables are increasing and the stocks have been in a rally since I planned for the bear market to keep getting worse since last September by selling stocks and waiting to get back in. The US economy isn't slowing down.

Missing out on the rally the past 2 months, now I think you are correct that the outright adversarial reporting by the main stream media is scamming small investors out of their savings and investments. The bear market seems to be over. Small investors planning for a bear market are getting burned.

Yesterday I decided that there probably isn't going to be a bear market. The markets and big companies like GOOGL will probably have a U-shape curve. When you look at the 5-year curve we are currently near the bottom where the decline is leveling off and probably will start will start increasing in price sometime near the end of next year.

I thought that with the balance sheet going from $4T to $8T, maybe the inflation will persist until the CPI doubles to be consistent with the money supply and available savings and liquidity bubbles. But also I worry that maybe the bubbles will remain inflated, and inflation would be limited by the increase in poverty for those who don't have money and those who pay 20% interest on the revolving credit card debt.  It seems the homeless population living in boxes, tents and shanty towns is going to increase by the 10s of millions of people in the next decade. Yet they may work for minimum wage and keep inflation down and the jobs re-shored in the US. So declining labor costs, declining pension liability may make up for any increase in cost of borrowing for companies for at least the next few years.  The market cap of AAPL and GOOGL may double, but real value may be the same as it is today. So I'm planning that the price per share isn't going to decline much. Today's market decline after the Fed meeting seems to be only ignorance, adversarial reporting by the news media and short term planning by most small investors regarding increased discount rates effecting the price of stocks and bonds.

406,"&gt;They found that increases in dividends are not positively correlated with future earnings. Which goes back to what you are saying, its more about trust than anything else.

I think it's probably accurate to say that a stock that pays a higher percentage of its earnings as dividend says nothing about its future earnings vs. peers. Rather that for those companies which pay out almost entirely their earnings in dividends, they trade closer to actual intrinsic value (hence the apparent premium) compared to peers who hoard cash. 

A fun analogy is that even though you might have shared finance with your spouse, the money in her pocket should be appropriately discounted compared to that in yours because there's always a risk that she will spend it on something that, in your opinion, was suboptimal.

A favorite trade/investment by value investors is to bet on when companies who decide to hoard cash will eventually return capital to investors, thus causing a rerating of its share price. Some influential investors even try to be that catalyst that cause a rerating. For example, Buffett invested in AAPL in 2016, befriended Tim Cook, and advised him to return its cash pile to shareholders. AAPL has since been trading at a premium (multiple expansion) compared to its past self. So  Buffett not only enjoyed the dividend, own a larger share of AAPL due to buyback, but also the paper gains from the multiple expansion that AAPL has gained since.",2022-12-13 15:49:54,2022-12-13,0.93

I loaded up above spy 400 on the list rally. I‚Äôm buy puts slowly during rally‚Äôs and selling them when they hit 100% return on the downswing.  I‚Äôve been burned a few times but my account balance lows are higher each time I get caught holding puts into a rally.  

If you‚Äôre better at timing the market with technicals than me then your portfolio could be up massively.  I‚Äôve held thru some rally‚Äôs even though I saw them coming.  I have my reasons.  But Its hard to see positions go from up 90% down to negative 50% but by buying exp that far out, so far they have come back for profit.  I‚Äôve only had a few positions that I had to close for a loss.  all in all I‚Äôm up about 1,000% for the year.  Had I flipped to calls when I saw the rally‚Äôs Coming Id be up WAY more.  

Right now I have a few Jan 20 expirations, a decent amount of Feb 17 expirations and just started loading up on March expirations.  I generally buy them right at the money.  

Because my account balance is up so much I‚Äôve never held so many positions as I do now.  I think this is my last hold and it‚Äôs my biggest.  The pattern is to consistent.  Something is going to break and I think we are approaching a bigger drop which may be the bottom.  I‚Äôll switch my strategy to doing the same with calls when I see the typical panic that sets in when something breaks.  

Next week is a big one.  I may unload some positions Monday before CPI just to ease my mind.  Still thinking on that.  But even if we get a good print I don‚Äôt believe the downtrend is over and I‚Äôll load back up during the rally.  

The inflation reports are noise.  We are way past due for a recession, inflation or no inflation.  It‚Äôs the normal business cycle.  Nothing has broken‚Ä¶yet.  When something breaks, I‚Äôll be buying calls.  

It appears things may get tough for many as recessions have real implications that generally suck for a lot of people so I hope this helps anyone make some money to weather it.

421,"I am. Current positions: weekly short strangle on AAPL and TSLA (options strategy betting on them not going up or down too much). It‚Äôs not gambling. As a trader I could go weeks without trading. Opportunities present themselves. The only reason I‚Äôm up is because I keep cutting my losses when I‚Äôm wrong (I‚Äôve gone long on TSLA, AMD, MSFT, and other stocks this year that ended up crashing a lot more but I was quick to sell to cap my losses) and I‚Äôm right more often than I‚Äôm wrong. 


People say ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt time the market‚Äù but that doesn‚Äôt mean you should stay in forever. The market is forward looking. It‚Äôs been obvious to anyone this year that the economy will get worse before it gets better. Earnings will come down before they start going up. Earnings have held up so far, which is why the market hasn‚Äôt even come down that much. The Dow jones is down less than 10% this year. SPY is only down ~20%. If you had asked any investor back in January what would happen if the Fed increased rates to 4.5% by December, they‚Äôd tell you the market will crash by 50%. Instead, earnings have held up surprisingly well. But soon that will change.

Last thing I want to say is I fully expect to miss the bottom when it comes, just as I missed cashing out at the top in January. I think the bottom will only become apparent months after it has already formed, in which case I will be late to the party. But I expect that the prices I get in will still be far lower than what I would‚Äôve paid if I continued to hold blindly throughout this bear market. Also I‚Äôm not a üåà üêª.

When the 2020 crash happened, my mind immediately thought back to 2008 and how I‚Äôd wish I‚Äôd invested then. Not really even thinking about the potential for a long and drawn out decline I started DCA into several stocks (XOM, M, STWD, F, OXY, AAL, NCLH, GOOGL, AAPL, etc.).  Turns out I got completely lucky with the market turning on a dime and exploding upward. Looking back now and how naive I was, I probably would have waited longer to get in because there was just no way to imagine Covid getting resolved and the whole world was shutting down and I would have missed the bottom. So in reality I timed it perfect but it was complete dumb luck. My return for the year was 70%. I sold many of those positions in early 2021. Now I‚Äôm back to around 60% cash and still sitting at roughly 190% returns since 2020.

**Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway discloses $4.1 billion TSMC stake**  
*Nov 14 (Reuters)* \- Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRKa) disclosed that it bought more than $4.1 billion of stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), a rare significant foray into the technology sector by billionaire Warren Buffett's conglomerate. In a Monday regulatory filing describing its U.S.-listed equity investments as of Sept. 30, Berkshire said it owned about 60.1 million American depositary shares of TSMC.  
The news sent shares in TSMC soaring, closing up 7.9% on Tuesday, as it boosted investor sentiment for the world's largest contract chipmaker, which saw its shares hit a two-year low last month due to a sharp slowdown in global chip demand.  
While Berkshire does not normally make big technology bets, it often prefers companies it perceives to have competitive advantages, often through their size.  
TSMC, which makes chips for the likes of Apple Inc (Nasdaq: AAPL), Qulacomm (Nasdaq: QCOM) and Nvidia Corp (Nasdaq: NVDA), posted an 80% jump in quarterly profit last month, but struck a more cautious note than usual on upcoming demand.",2022-12-05 00:18:27,2022-12-05,0.4235

A few of these are going to be worth holding but many aren't - you need to dig deep and see which ones you think have actual potential for massive cash flow generation down the road and whether the current prices are justified after accounting for growth. 

Personally, I have no confidence in SNAP, PINS, and HOOD. But NET and SNOW are definitely good companies although a lot of the price is future growth at this point. However, I wouldn't buy them unless I had strong conviction which comes from deep knowledge. RBLX and FSLY I have no opinion on. In any case, you need to do your own evaluation and then make an informed decision. 

TSLA, AMD, and AAPL do not fit this mould as they are relatively larger and more mature companies that are profitable and generate cash. They are also all moat companies IMO with substantial competitive advantage. However, this is not exactly a secret and the stock prices of these companies reflect that to some degree or the other. So you still need to evaluate and see whether you'd like to stay invested at these prices. I personally hold AAPL and see little reason to change that. AMD is one I wouldn't mind looking at at some point but I have found other names in the sector more attractive for now. TSLA is an interesting one. I would have a very hard time justifying an investment at this price and find Musk to be too volatile for my taste but they're obviously an insane company with a lot of crazy potential avenues for growth and the ability to actual tap into many of them.

479,"&gt; Statistically only a small minority of investors outperform the market

Well, no. Statistically, about half of them will.

Consider the following: broad market indices weigh companies by market cap. Thus, the amalgamation of passive funds hold the same % ownership in all companies. E.g., if passive funds hold 55% of all shares, they own 55% of AAPL as well as 55% of PTON, ZIM etc.

Thus, by definition, the remaining 45% of shares of all companies are in the hands of active investors/stockpickers. And, again by definition, this combined active portfolio will yield the *exact same* as the passive portfolio.

Now of course there are nuances:
- this assumes the results of active investors are normally distributed. While in reality a small group of outperformers (or underperformers) could skew the results. 
- not all companies are included in the world index. 
- it excludes the costs and fees associated with active management, which is why a lot of active funds underperform

But if you think about it: every horrible investor you see, slightly tilts your odds of outperforming the market in your favor",2022-12-02 12:41:27,2022-12-02,0.8608
480,"Something I tried to explain here ages ago which is really important for a company like SNOW is that growth has a non-linear impact on valuation - as growth increases you should expect valuation to increase exponentially. SNOW has a 60%+ YoY growth rate which is more than twice what a typical growth stock might have. If you're not considering this in your valuation comps you're making a mistake.

Something else to note with high growth rates is that current earnings, FCF and sales become meaningless. For example, even if you use SNOW's TTM sales to calculate a PS ratio it's not a good reflection of current sales. TTM sales are $1.6b while sales in the last quarter were $523m giving them a sales run rate of around $2.1b. So that drops their PS from around 30 to 23. High, but again, you need to put that in the context of growth rates and projected profitability. I'd also add that PS is a BS ratio anyway, EV/Revs is better and worth looking at over PS in SNOW's case given their cash position.

I guess what I'm saying is that SNOW is a lot harder to value than something like AAPL where you have consistent and steady numbers to look at. My guess is that a some people here are just looking at TTM ratios without modelling out future cash flow projections based on growth rates and margin expansion. When you do that you'll find it's not as expensive as it looks - based on my assumptions anyway.

Another thing that's impacting tech valuations right now is debt, FCF, and the direction of margins generally. SNOW basically ticks all the right boxes with billions in cash, positive free cash flow (no need for debt), and expanding gross and operating margins. The last one imo is notable because almost all tech companies are currently seeing contractions in gross and operating margins which makes near-term modelling difficult because you have more uncertainty about where margins will be. With SNOW everything is at least going in the right direction.

I own SNOW and I actually think SNOW should have fallen a little yesterday - I was quite excited to buy some more. I wouldn't buy it at $150 and I made a mistake earlier in the year not selling it when it when it hit $200 (was going to but had other things going on and missed the chance). Below $140 I think it's a buy, but that opinion is very dependant on rates.

I don't know why this sub hates SNOW so much. I'm not saying it's a great investment for everyone but at the current price this is a decent entry for a long-term position in a great company.",2022-12-02 10:25:07,2022-12-02,0.9698

The present valuation of nvidia means that it would need to double as a company 4-5 consecutive years to be in line with its peers and other growth companies. It is obviously not showing that prospect in the near term. Second, what is commonly referred to as this moat or monopoly by nvidia is inherently a bit contradictory. The scale of nvidia‚Äôs business is inherently not monopolistic at sub 30b revenues and their competitors growth in the same business segments is beginning to reflect that. Thirdly, tying into the scale aspect, we‚Äôve already heard from the likes of I believe aapl, Goog, and meta that they will be trying to self invest/produce their own data processing and they absolutely have the power to do such. A 30b sales co. being a monopoly forward looking is only if people let it be. It‚Äôs not a new company. I remember when people said, and somewhat still do say, that Nvdia dominates the gaming landscape, yet I can look at the growing inventory qoq and I know even that demand is waning before looking at competitors.

The point is, I don‚Äôt think anyone is saying that nvidia is a bad business or unviable, but people question if a company of this scale should be a top 10 most valuable company in the world when what you do is, while impressive and necessary to an extent, is deemed via your sales to be a drop in the bucket",2023-02-23 08:43:08,2023-02-23,0.844

I think this is the current iteration of what people thought about solar and ESG in 2020. And then EV‚Äôs in 2021. I remember MSFT making huge announcements and talking about how green they were on conference calls. Walmart talked about how many solar panel projects they were doing to go green. Now they‚Äôre talking about how much they‚Äôre putting in AI and no one cares about ESG anymore. AAPL announced an EV and then haven‚Äôt done anything since the hype train shut

I think like solar, it‚Äôs way further out for mass adoption than people think. Mostly for legal and liability reasons honestly, but also from technology standpoint. It‚Äôs new-ish to start getting publicly adopted and I foresee a lot of issues with liability and legal frameworks

So when you sell a stock you are triggering a taxable event. As long as you hold the stock, you are not taxed on the stock.

Now there are these things called Dividends. Dividends are a way the company can reward investors without requiring the investor(you) to sell the stock. Dividends can be paid monthly, 4x a year, yearly, or many other frequency's. SPY has a 1.56% dividend, meaning each year you get paid 1.56% of the value of your stocks in cash. Dividends trigger taxable events.

So you mentioned SPY. I'm going to assume you mean the ETF with the SPY ticker. A ticker is the 1-5 letter symbol used to identify a stock; AAPL=Apple, V=Visa, MSFT=Microsoft. A ticker can also identify an ETF; SPY=500 largest companies, QQQ=100 largest Tech companies, GDX=Gold Miners ETF.

ETF's are collections of stocks. So you don't have to manage investing in 500 different companies, someone else does that and charges you a small fee. This fee is called an Expense Ratio. A good expense ratio would be less than 10 cents per $100 invested. SPY has a 9 cent per $100 invested.

You should probably just hold on to your investment and let it pay dividends and grow through price appreciation. It is common to hold an ETF like SPY for decades.",2023-02-15 15:22:35,2023-02-15,0.9062

Conversely, had they diluted themselves by 20% they would've shown an EPS decrease of 25%. EPS can also be used to better understand unprofitable companies.

P/E is a ratio. Of the same earnings per share $ in relation to the per share price.

Share counts change over time, either dilutive or contracting. Additionally companies may trade over years based on their P/E in a tight range (all things being equal and interest rates being steady)

As a result of contracting shares on the market a higher EPS will push the stock price up, if investors believe the business demands the same P/E ratios, staying consistent in the range or needing to go higher on the range due to business quality improving.

Vice versa, if the company continues to dilute, they can have the same Earnings results but EPS goes down, reflecting a dilution of the company ownership. 

This is the story of AAPL and the rest of tech. AAPL will not dilute, they are strict on RSUs and focus on the shareholder and returning value.

161,"The stock market is like a casino and the gamblers with all the information make the most money (aka the pelosi effect). 

I feel the best advice is if you are young, go high risk and if you are older and closer to retirement, go low risk.

Im sure many people in these subs have invested for years and made or lost hundreds of thousands or even millions but to a large degree everyone will see their results as luck. The lady who put 100% of her portfolio in AAPL - how stupid, how lucky! The slow steady guys who invest every year in boring low cost ETFs. The gamblers with puts and calls. The market timers. The guys who only invest just before the earnings call. The technical chart guys.  Its easy to feel all of these characters are just getting lucky if they win big. Every one of them misses some fundamentally important fact according to the others. 

My feeling for a young person - invest in yourself (education, run a business), invest in property (a couple of rentals), invest is passive income streams, have a solid 401k setup, if you can invest some taxable money too, invest some play money in things like crypto. Dont worry about ups and downs - just reassess each year and try to make sure you have fingers in lots of pies. The most significant investment should always be in your own health.

Buy more, Gamble, Win big. If it goes down just keep buying more (dollar cost average) until you are ready to retire or at least close enough to avoid risk. Diversification is fine for older folks and people who are scared of gambling but look at the people who stayed in AAPL the last 10 years. Tesla will be a roller coaster but I feel its products are so so profitable compared to any other automaker with fewer long term liabilities. If you want to get rich, find a winner and stick with it, even double down on it. I know this is not popular advice here and its gambly but too many pull money out of winning stocks and invest it in safe but mediocre alternatives. If you can afford it, TESLA is a fine stock to bet the house on. It went crazy high, came back down and will probably to crazy high again at some point. Just enjoy the ride. 

So Im telling you to gamble. But look at the future. The cybertruck and freight business will bring huge profits, automated cars and taxis will bring huge profits, ongoing subscriptions will bring huge profits. Tesla is not just building nice cars, its a massive robot factory too. Musk is a genius and if you can afford to gamble, he is about the best bet out there right now (in my biased but humble opinion).

Not always: some people accept lower returns but value other factors like stability. I think some people buy MSFT/AAPL not because they think it will outperform the market in the future but because they are perceived as 'safe' and reliable. They are already trillion dollar companies and have less growth in the future than mid-cap stocks, for example. So they might play the role of a defensive stock like JNJ.

AAPL is not down that much, nor is MSFT.

But AMZN stock certainly has been pummelled.  They've been recently hated as a company and a stock.  That typically is a setup for a strong bounce.

We've seen it over and over.  Facebook was getting daily coverage for their evils, their idiot owner tripled down on ""metaverse"" and then the stock cratered.  Doesn't matter, stock is rebounding strongly.

Tesla was ludicrously overvalued, and has a psychotic fascism cheerleader and Russian puppet owner.  Product quality tanked along with reputation, and there's strong competition everywhere.  Doesn't matter, stock is rebounding strongly.

Nvidia hit a chip glut and people realized a lot of their business was from unsustainable crypo.  Yet it's had a 100% rebound on... nothing, really.

Netflix was mismanaged and hid the fact they hit customer saturation years ago and price saturation too.  Their desperate response was to call customers thieves for doing password sharing NFLX had always encouraged, then an incompetent money-losing ad-tier launch which, at best, cannibalizes themselves for low value customers and negative revenue.  Shady execs now pledging to hide the subscriber numbers.  Stock is up 150%.

So while I don't have confidence in Amazon to fix their business problems (like how most of their site and experience is just displaying data entries of offshore knockoff junk and counterfeit product inserted into their broken fulfillment structure) I would say that if it's anything like how the other floundering large ""tech"" companies have seen their stock price go parabolic without reason, they're in the best position.",2023-01-23 02:08:04,2023-01-23,-0.4268

Basically, I am waiting until their P/Es are favorable which means MSFT needs to be at $200 and AAPL needs to be between $100 - $110.  Earnings will be a big decider of that and since MSFT has announced a layoff, I'm pretty sure their quarter announcement will be bad since I've never heard of a company announcing positive earnings and a layoff at the same time.  I'm avoiding Amazon until Jassey can finish cutting all the costs that Besos implemented. AMZN needs to go to at least $60 for the valuation to make sense.

All of these numbers might take forever and I'm willing to wait.

The one that is the closest on a valuation level, for me, is actually GOOGL at a 19/20 PE.  Fair value is only about $10 lower than it's at right now, and again, another great company.

As for growth potential, that's very debatable at AAPL's scale given how much it makes already and the return to nonzero rates curbing growth.

Growing a company like AMD or PARA 50% is far easier because there's more of the market to capture.

The ways to make more money is to either sell to more people which won't work for much longer because population growth is slowing, or to extract more money from existing people which may drive them to competitors.

At some point, there is a cap to how much it can grow as at that point the economy would basically be AAPL and nothing else.

Mastercard (MA) is up more than 1300% since 2008. Monster Beverage (MNST) is up more than 1000% in the same time. Apple (AAPL) is up about 1900%.

Now these companies can‚Äôt continue to grow at these rates. They‚Äôre too big for that now. My point is your next ten bagger is out there waiting for you and they all tend to have the same characteristics.

346,"Charting works in the sense that you can identify zones where it may be be worth taking the risk of putting on a position, and charts are usually very good about revealing a stock's current trend.

Lines of support/resistance are called ""supply and demand"" zones, or pricing zones where heavy institutional buying and selling activity occur with increased volume. These zones appear for pretty much any stock, it's not just limited to those with heavy retail activity.

The general idea is that the institutional market movers tend to create these zones of demand (when the stock is on a line of support), and areas of supply (bouncing off a line of resistance) as they accumulate/distribute shares. 

These institutions generally have a price target they're trying to get to for any given position: and they obviously stand to gain much more if they optimize their entries to be closer to a demand zone rather than a supply zone. On that same token, they seek to sell high after achieving their previous price target, and this can cause supply zones to form as institutions unwind their positions.

Now with all of that said. none of this stuff is obviously set in stone: support/resistance lines can and often do get blown through when new information comes in and the fundamentals change. Some report can get released which will fundamentally change the supply/demand balance - and this can result in the stock price blowing through a line of support or resistance with ease.

Couple this with the fact that a lot of traders really suck at reading charts: they can oftentimes let their confirmation bias affect their interpretation of these supply and demand zones. This leads to scenarios where Trader A sees something but Trader B doesn't see the same thing at all. Cue all of the funny crayon drawings from WSB.

This is why you see people commonly roaming around here parroting the ""astrology for guys"" line - at any point, new data can come in to shake things up - AND, your ability to successfully read/understand a chart can be undermined by your own confirmation bias. I.e. if you're a really big fan of AAPL, you're going to be looking at that chart through a different lens than someone who doesn't have any real feeling about the brand.

*However:* discounting the confirmation bias noted above, sometimes it can be a while for new data to show up. Stocks are not always acting on new information that is market moving. They tend to follow a trend from their previous market moving data release until they get locked up in a supply/demand zone. Then they oscillate around with the rest of the market.

The problem is: reading supply/demand zones, reading stock trend, reading market direction, and subduing your own confirmation bias.. are really freaking hard things to do. It takes a lot of practice. And that's why most people recommend that you don't bother.

The fact is, however, there are traders out there that trade this way and they make an absolute killing doing it.",2023-01-16 00:23:48,2023-01-16,0.8046

Second, that's not how index average works.

Likewise, if ALL stocks (including AAPL) grew at 10%, the index would have grown at 10% and nothing would have outperformed or underperformed.

I understand the IBM hate, however I‚Äôd argue that they may be gaining access to some prime data sets in hospital partnerships that could be extremely valuable when discussing AI development, but I agree that I‚Äôm not actively buying them and wouldn‚Äôt be recommending them given the fundamentals. I‚Äôm a big believer in letting the winners ride (if they are established blue chips) and that‚Äôs probably how IBM is still in there. 

AOS feels like a pseudo monopoly but I wasn‚Äôt aware of the china stuff and will have to look into that. 

GIS is strictly more of a diversification play and a safe dividend that you can toss money at when everything else is on fire. Same idea with ADM. I think the stocks you dislike the most are those that have been performing the best recently (past year), and make the most sense in the context of a decent recession. So I would agree that these are probably overpriced atm, but in the larger scope of a balanced portfolio I think they might make more sense (at least gis and adm) long term. They will help to smooth the volatility. I think if I were trying to predict the stocks that will perform best in 2023 I‚Äôd bet msft, aapl, txn, c‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm also trying to set it and forget it at some point and just let it drip until retirement.

371,"Any self proclaimed ""long-term investor"" not considering the impact of both demographics and technology in the coming years is making a huge mistake imo. Today we often hear how industrial or commodity stocks are good long-term plays, but it seems to me these are really just bets on the total consumption of physical goods increasing which isn't going to happen with declining demographics and technology making physical items less important.

I think what we're more likely to see is a slow collapse in total consumption and the need for lower real yields along side inflationary stimulus policies because otherwise deflation will be hard to avoid. The only sectors with real returns are likely to be those in areas which focus on automation and the virtualisation of physical goods and services.

Imo long-term even companies like AAPL and GOOG in their current form will struggle to grow in real terms with a declining consumer base. Companies like MSFT may be okay if they provide automation solutions.

I think the long-term historic returns of the stock market will not be the same going forward. The boomers are a rich generation largely because they were able to leverage the huge growth of their generation. Unlike the boomers future generations will instead need to focus on where to preserve capital as deflation in real terms be much more common place.

To answer your title question, there is no plan, nor should there be. Immigration is a temporary fix at best. We need simply need to adjust to a world of where real growth is flat and in some places negative. Like it or not most of the develop world will be forced to follow a similar path as Japan over the next couple of decades.

375,"There is no ""market price"" there is only the last price at which a share sold. The only things that matter are the bid and the ask. For example...you can have a last price at $100 and if every current sell order is a limit order with an ask of at least $120 then you either buy at $120 or not at all. 

The problem with a big order at ""market"" is that you are limited by the available shares when you buy...so market basically means the lowest available asking price out there...and you keep buying at that number until you've acquired a million bucks worth.

So let's say you have the following limit orders in the system on the sell side

- 100 X $100
- 100 x $100.2
- 100 x $101
- 100 x $105
- 100 X $110

If you buy 100 shares at market, you get the ones at $100...if you buy 200 shares you get an average of $100.1...but if you buy 500 shares you get them at $103.24 but the last price will be $110.

With lots of volume this example won't happen because lots of people are buying and selling AAPL or SPY at any given minute...but a low volume stock could destroy you with a market buy.",2023-01-12 22:31:32,2023-01-12,-0.7543

I have an old brokerage portfolio full of stuff my dad had picked out 30 years ago that was on auto pilot, with me too sick or unaware or busy or afraid to mess with. I have regrets for not tuning it up 20, 15, 10, 5 years ago. I‚Äôm 52 and am trying to make up for lost time.

I bought a little bit of everything. Now that I can see what the best performers are, I‚Äôm going to buy more of the best ones. I regret not buying more a couple months ago, yet AM afraid that there could still be a crash. So I‚Äôm putting half of it in now. If the looming recession does come (at this point I just wish it would crash already so we can get it over with), my plan is to just buy more.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm ‚Äústocking‚Äù up on, looming recession be damned: AAPL (bought some at $135 and now it‚Äôs $165); AB (only 10 total, for the dividend, will add more later); AMZN (bought some at $95, now it‚Äôs 105); GOOGL (bought some at 95, now it‚Äôs almost 110); LLY (bought 1 share when it was $40 less, but it‚Äôs one of my best performers); MMM (lower than I paid, has good dividends); MSFT (bought some at $250- regret not buying more and now it‚Äôs getting close to $300; SCHW ($50- it‚Äôs deeply discounted right now and if it survives the recession will go up); a few more shares of T, for the dividend; WMT- bought at $140, now it‚Äôs 150, but will likely keep going up.

However, I'm not totally regarded, and understand that the stock has gotten way the hell ahead of itself.

The reason why it's not an awful play is obvious. It's the singularly obvious hardware AI play. Name another hardware based AI play that's even in the same realm of obviousness. You can't.

That's why it's running out of control.

Trying to predict who will win out with AI software is a crapshoot. Personally, I'm betting on GOOG, but it could be META, MSFT, AMZN, AAPL or some startup in somebody's garage right now. But if you want to predict the No.1 hardware winner, it's already a known commodity. For NVDA to get knocked off their perch, it would take a massive miscalculation on their part.

I started ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù when I was 21. I use quotes because I was like any other kid when they started living off of the dream of get rich quick through dumb luck with penny stocks and biotech. Actually made some respectable gains after learning how to scalp big pops in those sectors, but nothing massive.

Got a job after graduation, living at home, paid off car. So very little monthly expenses, I pretty much put all of my paychecks into my account and was in all big tech. For some reason, I was rattled enough in December 2019 to pretty much sell all my positions and talk of this Covid thing became more rampant. I was sitting on like 95% cash around 50k or so and then the drop hit. I all in‚Äôd on AAPL, AMZN,AMD. Took some profits after they rocketed and sure enough right before the market tanked last year. Sheer dumb luck. 

I am back in with pretty much the same positions plus QQQ. I love my big tech. At around 130-135k today at 27. Only thing that shifted is mentality from long term sit and wait to profit taking while still allowing winners to run. One of my favorite new things to do is sell CC on my positions when I think the market is stagnant enough and using the premium to fund my Roth. I‚Äôve buy in batches of 100 shares now just for this reason. Mainly got into QQQ for exposure to TSLA since I still don‚Äôt want to own them directly, too risky for me. The daily option expirations are also super helpful when I‚Äôm trying to avoid being exposed to movement days in the market if Daddy Powell is speaking or economic reports. I try to limit my opportunity cost as much as I can. So I can sell daily and avoid having to hold through a big catalyst where my CC could get blown by.",2023-03-29 20:21:52,2023-03-29,0.995

When I said to compare, having a share of QQQ and XLK (not XLX) just lets you see how they do daily and over time compared to your portfolio.  Of course you can do that without a share just looking online, but I think you will find that if you like tech, you won't need SPY and the others (except the KO/VZ part) if you held XSD/XLK/QQQ.  If you held those three as a base, you could then get heavier with AAPL or NVDA or whatever, especially what might make sense to be heavier with temporarily.

XSD is the best performing ETF for the past ten years, and the second best non-leveraged one for the past five years.  XLK the sixth best for the past five years, with only three semiconductor and two clean energy ETFs above it.

I'd also suggest having one share of XLK and QQQ to just compare your whole portfolio against.  QQQ could be a stand-in for META/GOOG/TSLA/AMZN/COST and XLK for AAPL/MSFT/NVDA/AMD.  Longterm it is a good idea to have an industry base ETF (like QQQ and XLK for ""tech"") and then go heavier with individual stocks.

87,"Here's how I see... There's a very high chance bonds will appreciate in price over the next few years as inflation drops and the US potentially enters recession. That is unless you believe ageing demographics and technology is suddenly inflationary or something because there's really no good reason to believe inflationary pressures will be structurally higher this decade than it was over the last. This is just my opinion though, there are people who disagree and think bonds yields will continue to rise, I just think their arguments are poor.

But that said, I think there are still risks. Again, this is just my opinion, but in my opinion bonds are not as safe as people believe they are. If you buy treasuries you're basically guaranteed to get the nominal value of your investment back, but this is very different from a real return of capital. I think people need to think about the risk of treasuries from a debt/GDP perspective in that should the US ever be in a position where it can't reasonably service its debts, then inflation would be used as a policy tool to repay bondholders without default as it was post-WWII when debt levels hit similar levels to today.

Realistically with US debt/GDP at something like 130% we're in a situation where the US simply can't afford to continue to run the kind of budget deficits it has been over the last couple of decades. But the solutions aren't straight forward, because cutting spending or raising taxes will slow growth which makes it even harder to solve the debt/GDP issue. And ageing demographics will only exacerbate the problem as more of the population retires increasing the burden of social security spending, while the taxable workforce stalls out.

But with a stock like AAPL if the US ever does decide to use inflation as a weapon to fight national debt then great companies will simply pass that inflation down to their consumers and they should act as an inflation hedge as their nominal earnings increase. However bond holders in real terms will effectively be ""wiped out"" in such a situation, or at the very least you will not see a positive real return on your investment.

This is an edge case scenario near-term, but one which will happen eventually as Munger has pointed out himself, https://www.youtube.com/shorts/oLTlZ0Xd3e8

So yeah, 90% chance it's a good time to buy bonds, unless you're worried that there will be another pandemic or war and the US will be forced to let inflation rip to fund a large deficit. Right now at 130% debt/GDP the US can just about manage it, but another shock to the system and I personally wouldn't want to be owning government bonds.",2023-03-27 12:41:15,2023-03-27,-0.9184

I just invested a bunch beginning in January. I stopped last week at 90 shares of AAPL (35 were bought when it was only $130/ share but I bought more at $160 because I dont want to bet that they will go back down to $130). I‚Äôm done for now though given the talk of a looming recession. I only have 5 shares of TSLA, because I bought at $135 as an experiment and now don‚Äôt want to pay the higher price, but I wish I had bought more. I‚Äôd like maybe 50 shares total. I did not know it was a trough though. We only see the peaks and troughs looking back, right? 

My plan is to keep cash in my brokerage savings account which pays 3.5% interest, then buy more AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMD, NVDA, TSM, AMZN, TSLA and others if they go ‚Äúon sale‚Äù during a recession. I‚Äôm waiting for the sale, but holding what I have, even if/when they go red. 

I‚Äôm holding everything for a long time though.

95,"i was just like you a couple months ago. was bagholding tesla at $245 for 6 months. dca'd down to $186 with over a 100 shares. had to see my portfolio at -45%, etc. wait for it re-bound, it was brutal. also had a ton of stocks on my watchlist. including penny ones

i decided it was too much. wiped out my watchlist on my broker app. had like 60. i now just watch sqqq, aapl, tqqq, qqq, spy, vix, cost, and hd.

my main bread and butter is just selling csps. sometimes if it's a crazy day and there's some huge movements, i like to scalp my own csps. then after, initiate the wheel if it goes against me. i personally do 1 week dte

i then keep the other remaining $ to trade tqqq/sqqq dependent on a good entry point. i usually always buy the cost dip too, especially if it goes around 465~.  i also save a few grand to fiddle around with options to scratch the itch.

i'm doing much better instead of watching over so many stocks and trying to find an entry point. this is just my personal style, and everyone is different. i also like this way better with a shorter watchlist as i was consuming so much time. i feel like the less time you're in the market, the more $ you make. also, selling the csps has been great because it allows me more time to work on my hobbies instead of just being glued to the screen trying to find a move. having theta work for you helps a lot. it's not foolproof  but the more layers you have working for you, the better.",2023-03-25 09:24:07,2023-03-25,0.9539

Look at the 5 year chart, AAPL has plateaued. AMZN and DIS however are near their 52 week lows.

Going for a QQQ or TQQQ might give a more reasonable risk profile if you believe in the transformative impact AI could have as it relates to tech products/workflows.

If you want to make a conviction bet on a single name, it is much harder. Even between NVDA and their customers there exist companies posed to gain, like Supermicro.

In my opinion, nvidia is going to own this next 5-10 year cycle similar to how tesla dominated the first 5-10 years of EVs (still going too). This is the secular dominance that is being priced in to the stock. For that reason, and many others, it's my conviction bet on the sector (yes, even at these prices).

But other companies at less lofty valuations still stand to benefit greatly from this technological shift, like msft, Google, amd, aapl, etc.. if it plays out as speculators speculate, it's going to look very similar to another tech-lead bull run. Not on hype - on the premise *and* delivery of productivity and efficiency (earnings) gains that are locked behind gates which only Nvidia holds the keys for (in a generic sense - aapl, tsla, and Google have proven capable of developing in-house AI chips. That is a trend to keep a sharp eye on in the space).

I would say, get an understanding of how markets give valuations on companies, both from objective and subjective measures first. Then, look at the field of products of services, listen to what the CEOs describe as their vision, and apply your own judgment on how the public and society might respond, and how that will feed back into balance sheets and market valuations.

Even if in the meantime it drops to a PE of 18, that's CAGR -1.8%. In 30 years, it's -1.3%.

If AAPL continues to be a cash machine, you won't care about this PE. They had a ROIC of &gt;50% two years in a row, and before that they have consistently had a ROIC of &gt;20%.

The loyalty of their userbase is pretty much ridiculous and they've been releasing great products (M1 Macbooks are incredibly popular among professionals, Airpods have been incredibly successful, iPad is the only tablet people know, Apple Watch has over 3x the market share of second Samsung). They have operational excellence that very few companies can compare to. Even if they fail with future products (like AR/VR, car), their current portfolio with increasing recurring service revenue is going to keep delivering incredible returns. Their customers are mostly well off and will keep buying expensive phones in a recession. Their loyalty is even higher with young users and not owning an iPhone is a source of embarassment among Gen Z.

PE is a borderline useless metric and anyone who is going to short AAPL based on that is an idiot, sorry.

But my cost basis in my Roth is $135, and my cost basis in my regular IRA is $141. The only thing that matters from a tax standpoint is the $170 right?

2. Does the wash sale rule apply to purchases/sales in the Roth and regular IRA accounts? For example, let's say I sell my AAPL in my standard account right now, and it would be a loss. Then, a week later, I make a $7500 contribution to my Roth for 2023 and I buy AAPL for it's current price. Would this cause a problem?

&gt; Privately-owned housing starts in February 2023 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,450,000. This is 9.8 percent (+/- 15.5%)* above the revised January 2023 estimate of 1,321,000

That is a 90% confidence interval of [-5.7, 25.3], or statistically indistinguishable from 0.

If you look at the other indicators reported by the [Census Bureau Index of Economic Activity](https://www.census.gov/economic-indicators/), housing start estimates have much larger confidence intervals / high uncertainty than the other ones.

**Useless comments on my portfolio + BTU Update**:

What a great day for my big tech holdings. AMD up 7.7%, GOOG up 4.7%, MSFT up 4%, SMH up 4%, META up 3.6%. I will soon be using these opportunities to trim (slightly) MSFT/AAPL/AMD as they are too big of an individual position. I'll move the cash into my small cap value ETFs, or from AMD to SMH.

Meanwhile, on the commodity side, yesterday I had went pretty hard on BTU/AMR/XOM/PSCE. Today I added to CF (fertilizer). Some exciting news on BTU is that Investor Relations told some folks that they are working hard to get the surety bond covenants taken care of before March 31st, and at the worst, a little bit into April. A blackout period will start pretty soon (between quarter end and the next earnings report), so they might not get time to start capital returns. But at least an announcement about it will soon occur. Follow @8750Capital and @tradedollarnut on Twitter for more news (you won't find it anywhere else).

If a company doubling in valuation three times in 6 years despite halving in valuation along the way is suffering, then sign me up. But, I hear you. I used to own NVDA and the swings are stressful.  If they weren't, I would be far better off holding now. The sell now and jump back in later impetus was too strong for me. 

There are many companies with names that you know right now that will have one thousand percent returns in your lifetime. In my lifetime, I regret not holding AMZN and GOOG, taking profits, and not jumping back in during lower prices. That is a different form of suffering. But, in general, high growth means high volatility, and the market will never let you get away with big returns without taking on a big long-term risk. If you want to do 60% stocks 40% bonds, then some of your stocks should be growth stocks that you believe in. 

I wouldn't advocate buying NVDA right now. APPL has all the cash it needs in a liquidity crunch with a P/E of 25, and Tim APPL could decide to launch more affordable AI-in-the-cloud system-on-a-chip servers with a version of the Metal shading language that gains market share in the AI-community. AAPL could release its self-driving car and VR headset (which is probably fluff unless its tracking is so good that it doesn't make you sick).

However, NVDA had a P/E of 60 when it cost $30/share in 2017, now it has a P/E of $135, but it costs $235 a share. There is no way NVDA was overvalued at a P/E of 60 6 years ago. It's earnings growth was tremendous then. It has fallen off lately with the crash of crypto and coins that don't need proof-of-work, and ASICs that are better for that purpose. Obviously, NVDA's share price has exploded since the release of chatgpt and people think that the need to train AI on its GPUs will keep its earnings growing. NVDA has an okay moat. AMD and AAPL are other supposedly overvalued stocks that can make GPUs, but they haven't invested in making a language that can replace CUDA's dominance in the AI-in-the-cloud field. But, ever stock with a high P/E will have wild swings, usually in tandem with the S&amp;P. In the long run, you will probably make your money back, but you will ride through many paper gains and paper losses and if you might need your money soon, then you can't afford to hold a high p/e company. 

In contrast, stocks that looked good to first order on paper, like SVIB, with its accountants crafting it to have a P/E of 4.18, were overvalued and the massive amounts of cash that were leaving the bank were buried deep in their quarterly report.

Don't take it from me, here's a 1995 quote from Charlie Munger:

&gt; Over the long term, it‚Äôs hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you‚Äôre not going to make much different than a 6% return even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you‚Äôll end up with a fine result. So the trick is getting into better businesses. And that involves all of these advantages of scale that you could consider momentum effects.

I'd much rather buy AAPL as a consumer electronics company at 25 PE than SONY at 15. AAPL's revenues grew at 10% annually (last 10 years), while SONY had a revenue CAGR of 0.6% during that time. AAPL has much higher margins, much higher returns on their capital. In 5 years, SONY's FCF shrank 25%, AAPL's grew over 70%. AAPL also has much higher brand loyalty (since you mentioned cult-like fanbase) and recurring service revenue.

So it's hard for me to see SONY as undervalued, even if its PE is much lower. As Charlie Munger said in the above quote, cheap is not enough for a long term investment. Or, like Buffett says:

&gt; It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.

*‚Äú****The Intelligent Investor****‚Äù by Benjamin Graham, first published in 1949, is a widely acclaimed book on value investing. Warren Buffett is regarded as a brilliant investor and Graham‚Äôs best-known disciple. According to Buffett, ‚ÄúThe Intelligent Investor‚Äù is ‚ÄúBy far the best book on investing ever written.‚Äù*  
  
**How to invest using Warren Buffett‚Äôs ‚ÄòSecret Sauce‚Äô**  
You don‚Äôt have to be a great stock picker like Warren Buffett to take advantage of dividend-paying stocks. That‚Äôs good to know, since in his latest annual report, which was released late last week, Buffett credited his success with dividend-paying stocks as his ‚Äúsecret sauce.‚Äù His stellar knowledge of stocks might scare and intimidate you, but Warren Buffett wrote in his 2012 Annual Report that, ""We truly relish the dividends we receive from most of the stocks that Berkshire owns."" **Buffett rakes in a collective $4.84 billion in annual dividend income** from the dividend paying stocks in his portfolio.   
The Oracle of Omaha, who hosted some 40,000 investors last weekend at his famed annual meeting in Omaha, clearly likes receiving dividends -- nearly 90% of his portfolio is in dividend stocks. So why exactly does buy them? The answer lies in understanding optimal capital allocation, or put your money to work for you. Your primary goal in investing should be to buy income producing assets. Instead of thinking that the burden is all on you, and that you yourself must perform admirably, and become a savant stock picker, why not boost your portfolio‚Äôs performance with dividend-paying stocks, just like Buffett.  
Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs (NYSE: BRK.A and BRK.B) portfolio includes energy stock Chevron (NYSE: CVX), which is riding is a 35-year streak of increasing its base annual dividend payout. Chevron gives a big boost to Buffett's bottom line with nearly **a cool billion ($964,107,966) in annual dividends**.  
The Oracle of Omaha and his investment team love bank stocks. In particular, they've really piled into Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), or BofA for short. Over the next 12 months, Berkshire Hathaway will collect **almost $909 million in dividend income** from BofA.  
Last year, Buffett and his investing lieutenants (Todd Combs and Ted Weschler) oversaw the purchase of more than 194 million shares of Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). While these common shares are netting Berkshire Hathaway $101 million in yearly dividend income, it's the $10 billion invested in Occidental preferred stock yielding 8% which is providing the bulk of **dividend income from this company ($800 million annually)**.  
Another big-time income producer that should come as absolutely no surprise to most investors is tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Apple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding by a considerable amount, and Apple is on track to provide Buffett with **$842 million in dividend income** this year.  
Buffett and his team are also raking in a boatload of annual dividend income from beverage stock Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). Coke is Berkshire Hathaway's longest-held stock (since 1988), and it'll likely be increasing its base annual dividend payout for the 61st consecutive year in 2023. Coca-Cola pays Buffett **$704,000,000 in annual dividend income**.  
Consumer staples stock Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) is one of Berkshire Hathaway's riskiest investments (and possibly Buffett worst stock, Kraft Heinz's balance sheet is weighed down by debt). Yet, the company behind such brands as Kraft, Heinz, Cool Whip, Kool-Aid, and Oscar Mayer, pays Berkshire Hathaway **$521 million in yearly dividend income**.",2023-03-08 22:13:00,2023-03-08,0.9897

Also, this is HIS money, so maybe you should have the ""talk"" that you disagree with his position and are not going to bail him out. But really, bro, be **EXTREMELY** cautious about inserting yourself into someone else's financial investing. There are only a few scenarios here where you come out looking good.",2023-03-08 20:47:28,2023-03-08,-0.4477

There's too much speculative/lower quality/small growth that has not fared well and is likely to continue to face some difficulty as rates ramp - PLTR, STEM, CHPT. CHPT is an instance where the story is interesting - there needs to be a further build-out of EV infrastructure - but it's still questionable how good a business this is and is likely to continue to rely on subsidies. I think there's maybe too much of an eagerness to call the end of gas station operators especially smart, well-run ones like Couche Tard who have EV plans and will likely in this environment have an easier time funding them.

I don't like SOFI or really fintech at all, but that company for whatever reason has become something of a meme. Digital banks are still banks and slightest hint of a downturn the growth story goes away and a bank is a bank and all of the sudden the risks (loan book, etc) are appreciated. After what has happened to a lot of fintech in the last year (UPST, SOFI, AFRM, etc) I can't see people buying in to the same degree as they did in 2020 when growth gets a more consistent bid again.

Basically it turns out that many institutional holders of shares move slowly and tend to just buy and hold.

So what causes the price to fluctuate?  The only thing that moves the price are if there are more people willing to buy or sell AT THAT given moment.  It can be a small fraction of total shares and they can move the price A LOT.

So yes it's supply / demand but only supply demand that is activated at the current price levels which is often a fraction of total shares.

Eg. Buffett owns a fuckton AAPL, IIRC BRK is the largest owner besides ETFs.  AAPL could go to $200 and Buffett ain't gonna sell shit.  He's gonna hold that shit forever, so someone like him won't change the price, except when he buys (which he has been doing lately).",2023-03-08 05:42:30,2023-03-08,0.9008

189,"It's hard to say what Nvidia should be valued at.

There are people who point at NVDA's 130 PE.

But when that 130 PE came from 2022 which included the following: 2.17bn inventory charges, china chip ban, 1.35bn arm termination fee, change to proof of stake destroying crypto mining (NVDA's 'gaming' revenue which was cut in half), worldwide poor macro conditions (rate hikes + inflation) leading to companies and consumers cutting spending where possible, gaming GPU is one of the first to be cut in the personal budget

I'm sure I could be forgetting a few things but I would not use 2022 as an indicator of the future given the above are either one-off events (termination fees and write downs which added back brings NVDA's PE to 70) or factors outside of NVDA's control (chip ban and interest hikes)

Their recent massive rally can be justified depending on whether the AI boom will fuel NVDA sales in the long term which is highly speculative.

There's also the scenario that AI does take off, but their large customers develop their own chips. 

'Gaming' alone will never justify their market cap, that's why they're chasing the corporate money.

The reason I've personally been holding for a long time is:

1. One of the very few if not the only mega tech company still run by the founder who is also an engineer. MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META and GOOGL all became massive in their fields under the leadership of their founders.

2. History shows that while there are failures, the investors who hit  at home-run 100x bagger are the ones who held AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA when their futures were NOT certain and the valuations were NOT 10-20 PE. AMZN was always (still is) unprofitable or trading at insane PE ratios, yet that didn't stop them from being a great investment. When TSLA when burning cash and their survival was in question, that was the time where an investor hit it 100x. AAPL once had triple digit PE before the massive iPhone profits came in. MSFT was before my time but who invested in the 80s or early 90s when a PC in every home was NOT the norm, nor was it inevitable it would be the norm.

3. While it paid for earlier NVDA investors, and some think it's too late (it may be too late) I remember people thinking AAPL half a trillion market cap was too late. People who invested when AAPL was the biggest company in the world a decade ago were rewarded with 1000%+ return when including dividends.

There is speculative upside and downside, always will be, but I think long term investors ought to be optimists just seeing how companies continue to surprise in how much innovation (and profits) they can deliver.

257,"I am 26, so I have several decades until retirement. My goal is to hold the stocks in my portfolio perpetually, though I'm not reserved to make adjustments and sell when a) I see an opportunity to take profits b) my thesis changes. My long term goal is passive income generation, though I don't chase yields. I don't pay much attention to valuation or macro, as I think that since I plan on holding these stocks for decades while buying every month, those don't matter to me much. I invest regularly every month, so I'm okay with buying at a higher valuation at times and lower valuation at other times. In my opinion, buying at the best possible time is more difficult than buying a good company. That said, if I see an undervalued stock I like, I don't hesitate to buy more and when I make my regular contributions, I try weigh towards stocks that might have been beaten down or seem undervalued. My last review in one of these was [Dec 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r6bdjt/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread/hn1ot2t/). Since then, I have made some adjustments, mostly by researching new companies and updating what I focus on when doing my analysis. I am pretty comfortable with my current portfolio and can see myself holding any of these companies for decades (that surely won't be the case, but I'm okay with that; not all of these will be good investments, but most of them should, I think).

My goal is not doing 50% in a year or buying low and selling high. My goal is to outperform the index modestly, at maybe 2-3% annually, which would compound very nicely over decades. I'm okay with the risk that I underperform at a modest rate. I want to avoid making drastic changes to my portfolio depending on macro environment.

I like stocks that are quality companies with:

- A sustainable business model - high cash flow generation, high ROIC / ROCE, good balance sheet. Bonus points for recurring, diversified revenue, and optionality.
- Business model and products I understand, or at least understand their value. I don't think I'll ever understand ASML's machines, but I understand why it's one of a kind company.
- A wide moat. Bonus points are for brand value, network effect, IP, barriers to entry / high switching costs, supply chain, etc. I am okay with paying a high multiple for a company that cannot be replicated by throwing money at the problem. Almost every company I own scores very high in this regard in my own checklist.
- High margins. I focus mostly on gross margin, but consider other margin metrics, too.
- Sustainable buybacks and dividend growth.
- Great management.

Not every company I own scores high in each of these, but together they fit my investment goals very well.

I used to have an allocation for growth in my portfolio, but overtime, I have decided to fully target quality companies and compounders with a great track record. I realized that it is never too late to buy into a company once it becomes profitable and sustainable. And if I miss a few 10-baggers because of restraint from unprofitable companies, I'll be okay with that.

My current allocation is 96% equity, with the rest being a single commodity holding - a carbon allowance ETF (CARB on BIT)

Of the 96% equity, 1/3 (32%) is in diversified ETFs:

43,"Haha Yee. A little more detail is I work on their one of their main LOBs and the people I work with are all really smart and I have a slight idea from that work and their reporting calls that there is a huge push on Azure and cloud services, ai integration into their products to improve productivity not just internally but for all msft 365 users (of which I think the excel integrations are the coolest), and I like what they are doing to earn business there. I just think their team overall is moving in the right direction. 

I use them for everything and for the most part the Ecosystem is pretty flawless despite what some people will say. I actually really like their products. I also think they are executing on development of that ecosystem on all fronts not just the cloud part (like Amazon) and google is no where close to what msft is. 

And in this their customer base is massive which spreads the risk of any one LOB across many different areas - ooo consumer sales down? All good, azure/enterprise is up Etc etc. 

Speaking of growth and acquisitions - I think Satya is doing a great job. The acquisition of GitHub was genius, open AI and Activision are deff notable and the Xander grab was very smart too as they build out their marketing and analytics wing. but it‚Äôs the acquisitions they are making for cloud products, cyber security, IoT and data management that prove my other point that their focus is on growing in these key areas which is huge. 

I like satyas reserved but aggressive approach. They grow but they don‚Äôt acquire a lot of fat doing so and what he‚Äôs been able to do since taking over is nothing short of legendary. I think he is one of the best current CEOs in the game and will go down in history as such. And because of his style he has built and equally impressive team around him which as we all know is almost more important than being a good ceo. 

Last but not least I like the stock because I‚Äôve been following it for a while now. I understand how it moves and where it‚Äôs levels are. I like that it pays dividends. I like that it‚Äôs a good balance of defensive but more than enough upside for me for long term growth. I think it handled this down turn really well and while it doesn‚Äôt move like Aapl or google it‚Äôs definitely a more measured safe bet for me. I like that it doesn‚Äôt get looped in with these ultra high growth tech companies and I think that‚Äôs a plus. 

I just really like this stock and this company. I could end up being dead wrong but for it to turn against me we would need like another Steve Ballmer era, some dark horse move out of google/Amazon or some major catastrophe for that happen and I think I pay enough attention to defend against that happening.",2023-04-16 04:16:40,2023-04-16,0.9981

78,"Just depends on your goals, levels of risk, and time perspective. 

The crux of the arguement really is, are you investing or trading. Those are two different things with different goals. 

I do think AAPL is overvalued at these levels, but I do think AAPL will be worth more money in like 5 years than it is now.",2023-04-13 15:57:13,2023-04-13,0.6647

This group was chosen by my financial advisor who my family has a long history with at this point. Please don't respond by telling me that financial advisors shouldn't be used. On the other hand what small improvements could be made? I personally think that I should have some money in Lowes since it's the other major home improvement chain in the US.

Also, part of me just really wants to invest in Nintendo as I grew up with their products and the overall cost per share is relatively small. Plus they're opening a theme park and came out with a new movie. I feel like they are really starting to take advantage of their IP outside of gaming for the first time.",2023-04-13 15:50:54,2023-04-13,0.95

86,"Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.",2023-04-12 16:53:24,2023-04-12,0.8347
